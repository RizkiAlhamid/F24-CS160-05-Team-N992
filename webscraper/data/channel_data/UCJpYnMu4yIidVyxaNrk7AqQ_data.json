      "transcript": "Many people have rigid ideas about wildlife and wild spaces. They expect that wild animals\nshould stay away from cities. But  the reality is far from this. And even in a crowded city like Mumbai. Nature  has found its way. Our city is surrounded by an ecosystem like no other. A place where the changing tides control the life around it. and perhaps a place which is an unparalleled example of urban wildlife. Mangroves As a kid I remember we were taught in school that mangrove is like a superhero tree. It is a tree\nwhere no other tree could survive. They support a lot of biodiversity. The dense root system of mangroves helps the fishes for spawning. A lot of birds come and nest\naround the mangroves. But what we were\nspecifically interested in, were the mammals. The golden jackal. Almost for a decade now, I've been working in Mumbai,\nunderstanding, studying the urban biodiversity. Mumbai is blessed to have a mix of two habitats, the sea and the mountains, the city supports a lot of wildlife. So we had a prior information that there are jackals\nin Mumbai's mangroves. But then, there was no comprehensive study on, this jackal population So with this objective in mind, we, collaborated with WCS-India. And finding jackals in the mangroves might not be as easy as you think. Everything was dependent on the tide. We couldn't go just after the tide had gone down, then it could be very mucky and our legs would go deep in the mud.  This landscape is practically a maze, where the routes\nkeep altering with the changing tides. If the team had to solve this puzzle, they would have to learn\nfrom someone who knows who knows this landscape. It is not very easy to go out and spot them. We wanted to understand where these jackals are, how are they distributed? To do that, we used camera traps. Camera traps helped us be at places, when we actually werenâ€™t there. The team deployed camera traps at over 68 locations. What makes this even more interesting is that the camera traps were not set  only in the heart of the mangroves, but also along the periphery where the human activity was dominant. However, when the tides came in, not all camera traps survived. We lost a lot of camera traps.  Some of them also got stolen. But the worst was we not being prepared for the tides. Over the span of six months, the team deployed camera traps \nthroughout the mangroves of Mumbai. And the results caught everyone\nby surprise. There were species like grey mongoose, small Indian civets  and even jungle cats\nthat were captured on camera traps. And then there was the apex predator of Mumbai mangroves. the golden jackal. However, there were some signs of concern. Even deep inside the mangroves. there were records of free ranging dogs. There were quite a few incedences where we saw  domestic dogs chasing golden jackals. They were using similar trails. Marking territories at the same spot. We also wanted to look at the interactions which were taking place between jackals and humans. How are the jackals\nsurviving in this urban landscape with so much pressure? The answer was right in front of our eyes. We looked at the time. And we clearly observed that the jackals were highly nocturnal. with peaks between dawn and dusk. So, in order to survive in this landscape \nwhere there were lot of people, one simple thing jackals did was avoided them during the day. We found that\nthere are at least five packs with pups at different age classes, We could observe some which were newly born. some pack which had a little grown up pups. Among the chaos of people, urban encroachment and competition\nwith dogs The presence\nof breeding population of jackals in these mangroves is a sign that they are not just surviving, but flourishing in Mumbai. And there's more to this story. There was one particular image which really shocked us all. Because we had photographed a leopard walking in the mangroves. I had never imagined making a photohraph where a leopard is walking through pneumatophores. So golden jackals, leopards are just the flag bearers  of this entire cohort of species\nwhich live around humans They are very well adapted to maneuver around these spaces\nand survive in these ever challenging landscapes. I think it's high time we acknowledge the existence of urban biodiversity."
