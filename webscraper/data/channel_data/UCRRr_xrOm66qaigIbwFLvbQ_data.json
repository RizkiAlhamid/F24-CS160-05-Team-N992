      "transcript": "you've probably heard of a Tipping Point right A system that has a point Beyond which just a small change can suddenly dramatically change the whole system you may have heard of climate tipping points for example if the world warms too much Arctic permafrost might melt releasing tons of methane into the atmosphere or the Atlantic meridianal overturning circulation might shut down plunging Europe back into Ice Age conditions but did you know there are also climate tipping points that scientists want us to hit they're called a positive Tipping Point is a point where a small change can have a disproportionate effect after which the system becomes self-propelling to be extremely clear these tipping points are not physical like the circulation in the Atlantic or the Amazon rainforest dying back instead these are social or technological tipping points so for instance if one more person buys an electric vehicle that creates a positive interaction with other people making this the dominant technology really good example not that long ago there were barely any electric vehicles on the road and so when somebody bought one and drove it around it showed other people that these things existed but also that they were cheap to run that they didn't produce any tailpipe emissions and that they were quiet and that made other people more likely to buy one and that effect only became more pronounced the more people bought electric cars if we put time on our horizontal axis and electric vehicle uptake on our vertical axis then uptake will look something like this over time to begin with basically nobody is buying electric vehicles but as that positive feedback loop starts to kick in driver starts seeing other electric vehicles on the road then the curve starts shooting upwards eventually it gets really really steep which can't last forever it has to level out like this because eventually everybody's going to have an electric car the system has changed to a new state if that sounds ridiculous to you as an example you might want to look at Norway electric cars now outnumber cars with internal combustion engines in Norway and in July this year over 94% of all new cars bought there were electric the transport sector in Norway reached a Tipping Point I made a whole video about why there specifically on nebula and other countries are on a similar trajectory sure the US for example is down here on the S curve less than 10% of new vehicles bought in the US this year were electric vehicles but China is about here more than 50% of new vehicles bought in China this year were electric but electric vehicle uptake isn't the only low carbon system with a Tipping Point scientists have identified several Key Systems relevant to climate where change can be modeled as an S curve we'll come back to that where we're seeing the early stages of exponen potential growth with a huge shift a Tipping Point on the horizon so what are these systems this paper interviewed experts from across Academia and identified six climate tipping points that could be reached in the next 15 to 30 years though the paper doesn't call them tipping points they instead call them social tipping elements because Academia these tipping points were more information becoming available about our carbon footprint increased awareness and understanding of climate change oh hey that's what I public opinion turning against fossil fuels the withdrawal of financial support for fossil fuel extraction I made a whole video about that cities becoming carbon neutral I just made a video about this and low carbon energy yielding higher Financial returns for producers than energy produced by burning fossil fuels that last one is seen as particularly important because energy literally underwrites civilization unfortunately however we are still a way off that Tipping Point psych we're already there this paper was published in 2021 back when they said of this energy Tipping Point the empirical data show that this critical threshold is about to be reached the prices of Renewables have dropped sharply in the last few years and they have already become the cheapest source of energy in many world regions this year the International Energy agency estimates that $3 trillion will be spent on energy and of that 3 trillion 2 trillion will be spent on clean energy and infrastructure total spending on renewable and grids is for the first time greater than total spending on oil coal and gas the positive Tipping Point in energy has been reached and we can see that really clearly in this report from nonprofit RMI which found clear exponential growth in global solar deployment and battery cells far outpacing any previous predictions we're currently living in the Steep part of the energy scurve though it is important to note that energy doesn't just mean electricity energy use means electricity use but also transport heating cooling industrial applications agriculture loads of different sectors the energy Tipping Point that we have reached is really a Tipping Point in electricity production the carbon intensity of other uses of energy especially transport has basically remained the same though the fraction of all the energy we use that comes from electricity has been steadily increasing which is great news because if you can elect fire sector and then power it through Renewables you can really lower its carbon intensity and make it much more efficient and if you want an example of where this is happening really quickly look at China China has recently rolled out a truly staggering quantity of Renewables especially solar last year they added more solar capacity than the US has in its entire history the reason for this is because the price of solar panels especially Chinese solar panels has plummeted solar electricity is now the cheapest form of energy for lots of applications hence why the Chinese energy economy is becoming increasingly electrified but cheap Chinese solar panels isn't just good news for China so because China is one of the main producers the price the cost to to produce electricity has become quite similar in different countries because most countries imported from China which means that in some sense we have more of a global tipping points than in some other sectors like heat pumps which have very highly variable prices across countries that said some technologies like wind for instance do have European producers that produce for very low costs as well but we didn't just hit that solar Tipping Point with cheap solar panels and exponential uptake by Chance the authors of this paper and scientists more generally are Keen to stress that we don't just need to wait for these tipping points to happen in fact through smart government policy we can accelerate our progress towards them and our way down the S curve with targeted interventions get away for example how exactly did solar panels become so cheap I'm oversimplifying but starting in the late 2000s the Chinese government started providing large cheap lowrisk loans to Chinese solar companies which took those loans scaled up their operations started to benefit from economies of scale and invested in R&D and the result are solar panels that are 10 times cheaper now than they were at the start of the century it was a government policy designed to intervene in the Solar Market obviously to benefit Chinese interests but also to bring down the cost of solar electricity and other such interventions are known to exist going back to the 2021 paper interventions that could accelerate us hitting the non-energy Tipping points include the creation of specifically carbon neutral cities inspiring building codes elsewhere promoting the investment movement reducing the value of fossil fuel assets simulations suggests just 9% of investors divesting from fossil fuels could be enough to tip the whole system and improving resources available to Educators about climate change but why stop with just trying to flip one system into a new state what if you could design a small precise intervention that would cause a Tipping Point Cascade multiple systems one after another flipping into new stes well FEMA has just released a new paper on what she calls super leverage points so we identified two super leverage points in uh in our work one is a call phase out if we can accelerate a call phase out depending on on how far countries are along and force countries to use cheaper solar and wind and batteries then that can drive down electricity costs which because we're electrifying everything has rep Rion in all the other sectors a previous study also found that mandating fertilizers be produced with a certain fraction of green ammonia so that's ammonia produced with hydrogen made through renewable electricity as another Super leverage point because that would mean through economies of scale green hydrogen becomes more affordable and so hydrogen-based Solutions in other sectors like shipping and steel become more viable though still not heating houses just get in the bin with that idea but the other super leverage point identified in this new study which was the first one to quantitatively look for these tipping points in the electricity sector is a mandate for electric vehicles if you put such a mandate in place this has repercussions on all three other sectors we studied so for the trucks it's quite simple it's the same or very similar technology so innovation in one technology will also lead to innovation in the truck phace the second one is that the battery in cars can be used in the power sector in three ways so you've got vehicle to grid applications you've got a secondhand Market of these batteries and the third one is that you also have battery that you would buy for your grid independent of these cars and you can use those uh Insight from Innovation from cars for your power sector applications so that becomes cheaper which also means that electric cars become cheaper heat poops become cheaper because electricity is cheaper but just a minute minute I I'm going to do something that I don't usually do in these videos I'm going to step outside of the discussion I'm going to need a coat hang on we are talking about making changes to society that will have huge impacts and this is something that is a constant Factor when you're talking about climate stuff but it feels especially pointed here because you're by Design talking about making the smallest possible changes to produce the largest possible impact and while we call them positive tipping points we can't ignore the fact that there will be negative consequences associated with hitting some of them for example if you phase out coal then that's going to negatively impact people who are employed in the coal industry and that can be entire areas now I'm not trying to say that we shouldn't have a coal phase out because I very much think it is a net positive thing to do but we can't ignore those negative consequences so the question of who gets to decide which tipping points are targeted and in what Manner is an important one should it be politicians designing these policies or should it be scientists if so which politicians which scientists should this be a democratic process where everybody get a vote because this will impact everyone or is democracy too slow to implement change at the pace that we need the Tipping points group at the University of exter has the statement in one of their papers that if we don't decide this stuff now the future will decide for us and that version of the future will almost certainly be worse for us I don't think many people would disagree with that but it still sidesteps the question of who exactly gets to decide I would be very interested in what you have to say about this please leave a comment with who you think gets to decide this stuff because everybody should have an opinion about this this is huge stuff we're talking about that will impact everyone and I'm just a physical scientist by training I'm not a political or social scientist let alone a philosopher who do I think has the right to make this decision I I can't say I don't know what I can say in this video is that the world is currently hurtling towards various tipping points and we're likely closer to many of them than you think and while many of those tipping points are negative some of them are positive and if we hit those ones first it could profoundly change how we live our lives and how much damage we do to our planet oh uh yeah not everybody agrees on what is and isn't a Tipping Point and some social scientists argue that physical scientists are borrowing techniques from their field and implementing them sloppily or too broadly or without a full enough understanding of the literature and they suggest that one of the reasons why physical scientists are doing this is because it gives them it gives us hope the sustainability imperative that dominates much of Global Science and governance processes today combined with the sense that we are running out of time is a key motivator for social tipping research and it's success in review processes as the possibility of failure is looming larger every day we are eager to find new levers of change that can speed things up and Trigger rapid Transformations towards new sustainable stable States and there are certainly some dubious studies that draw historical parallels that I'm not convinced are necessarily appropriate and maybe assume a level of control over some systems that we can't be sure that we have I'm mentioning this for completeness sake I'm not trying to say that tipping points don't exist I think they do I think most academics would agree with me but perhaps they are not as numerous as they are in the literature and I do think that we need to be careful in how we discuss them but here's the rub just as there are physical negative climate tipping points that we don't want to hit there are social and technological positive climate tipping points that we do however we cannot fall into the trap in discussing these positive tipping points that we can somehow fix climate change with just a few targeted policy interventions people have just got to stop believing in nudge Theory it doesn't work the transition to a low carbon future is going to be hard it's going to take a lot of work and time across basically every sector but it's already happening and in certain sectors progress can leap and indeed is leaping forwards and maybe just maybe in these sectors there are a few government policies that if properly enacted can cause not just a Tipping Point in one area but a Tipping Point Cascade and I don't think the hope we can take from that idea is a false one now if you've seen a YouTube video before this is where you might expect me to say hey remember that video I mentioned earlier about electric cars on nebula well you can sign up with this link but no I'm not going to do that instead I'm going to tell you about this half hour documentary I made about designing and building this new YouTube studio and this hourlong actual play video of climate scientists playing the best board game about fixing climate change and my video about Norway and electric cars the point being I've made a lot of stuff that's available on nebula nebula is like Netflix for people who like trains it's a place where some of your favorite creators upload thoughtful videos to a platform that we co-own our videos are available on nebula before anywhere else and in many cases aren't available anywhere else I've already met mentioned some of my exclusive content but there are more than a hundred creators doing so such as real life law NY red climate town and Tom Nicholas and then of course there's the content produced by nebula such as the getaway this is a show starring a range of YouTubers traveling across America competing for a cash prize by completing tasks and trying to sabotage the other contestants it has possibly the best twist I've ever seen in one of these shows which I don't want to ruin you'll just have to watch it for yourself a subscription to to nebula that allows you to watch everything ad free and also to download videos to your device for I don't know long train Journeys is split between nebula itself covering costs and financing new shows like the getaway and the creators that you watch so by watching my videos on nebula you directly support my work far more than by giving me a view on YouTube and frankly you also get a better viewing experience too to get such a subscription which is usually $6 a month head to / Simon Clark where you can get 40% off an annual plan meaning it costs just $25 a month that's $25 a month to get access to a huge library of highquality thoughtful content free yourself from watching ads and support independent creators like me nebula.com a huge thank you to those people who support me over on patreon.com/crashcourse Johnson very long-term supporter of this Channel and Diddy Barry truly you are the fastest of all patrons if you'd like to watch another video from me here's to I prepared earlier please do the YouTube pleasantries pop me a like leave your thoughts in a comment below and that just needs me to say thank you again for watching I'll see you in the next one"

      "published_at": "2024-09-10T15:33:05Z",
      "transcript": "if you think about it cities are amazing cities are the accumulation of human endeavor layer upon layer of history with the bones sticking out into the present long ago people found a place that looked nice and built houses houses that became homes homes that became communities we connected each other with social institutions some more secular than others and connected our homes with roads As Cities grew new Services appeared to protect the community and to serve it new infrastructure was built reshaping the landscape new buildings were constructed to integrate with a global Community providing new Services new ways of making a living and new ways of well living and as the last layers of History are laid down a city is further from its natural beginnings than ever before and faces new challenges in the 21st century cities home to over half the world's population must adapt to a warmer climate in fact those living in urban areas especially those from economically and socially marginalized communities will disproportionately suffer the effects of climate change with cities disproportionately contributing to the problem they make up over 70% of total greenhouse gas emissions so a large part of addressing the climate crisis is making our cities lower carbon but what about negative carbon can we build cities that actually suck carbon out of the atmosphere well according to this paper yes Mendes etal proposes four key ways cities can become carbon syn sinks in this video we'll explain these four ways Implement them in our model City and see how they measure up to the problem at hand the first way is perhaps the most obvious through Greenery green spaces in cities include Gardens parks and even forests expanding these will obviously draw down carbon through photosynthesis but so too will Green Storm water infrastructure much of the modern city is built from impermeable materials like concrete and tarmac when it rains heavily water courses over these materials and can rapidly accumulate causing flooding and flushing pollution into local waterways while this has been historically managed by pipes and tunnels green storm water infrastructure absorbs and filters storm water when it falls using plants this can be accomplished with green roofs and walls rain Gardens and bios swes these are green spaces designed to capture runoff so it can soak into the soil over time managing storm water in this way is an example of a co- benefit to a city of increasing Greenery while the main objective is to be a carbon sink you can accomplish other things too by protecting or building new green spaces in cities you increase people's connection to Nature restore biodiversity and lower temperatures trees provide shade and through a vapor transpiration cool down the local area really quite significantly oh and suck carbon out of the atmosphere it's estimated that if cities really lent into greenify their spaces globally they could draw down between 100 and 300 million tons of CO2 every year that sounds like a lot but remember last year the world emitted around 40 billion tons of CO2 greenify the world cities would be the equivalent of removing the emissions of a large European country pretty good but not enough maybe we'll have more luck with the second technique which is a little deeper and I mean that literally it's the soil cities are built on Urban soil is mostly Limited in how well it can support life by its capacity to hold water and nutrients some scientists propose to improve soil's capacity to hold both by adding biochar this is organic material burned at very high temperatures without oxygen similar to Charcoal but unlike charcoal in theory creating biochar does not create carbon emissions instead it's a way of taking carbon that might quickly make its way into the atmosphere for example through rotting and fixing it into a chemically stable form that isn't going to go anywhere add biochar to the soil or green roofs or storm water infrastructure in a city and you improve the growing conditions for plants aiding biodiversity but you also bury the carbon in the biochar for potentially centuries if that organic material was sustainably sourced or if it was waste product from sewage or garden waste it becomes another carbon sink with co- benefits for the city sounds great but a lot of people have problems with this idea I'll leave a link to a paper critiquing bioart in the description but in short it's very possible to create this stuff in an unsustainable way and there's no guarantee that it's a net positive for soil Health but assuming that this can be done sustainably surely this is a way to fix massive amounts of carbon into urban soil well according to mes at out actually maybe just 50 million tons a year equivalent to the emissions of Bulgaria and even then there's lots of uncertainty that the authors note we may need to look at the Third Way of drawing down carbon for something more substant and you can't get much more substantial than buildings roads infrastructure similar to the previous point if you lock carbon into a building then it might stay there for hundreds of years organic building materials like wood Can Be an Effective carbon sink again if sustainably sourced and while not everything can be made of Timber the list of buildings that can't grows ever shorter new materials like cross laminated Timber and glue laminated beams allow Woods to be used in even high-rise buildings with the added benefits of taking fewer emissions to produce and generally being faster to build with cities are going to expand significantly this century and Mendez ated out estimate that if new Urban construction was largely done with sustainably sourced Timber Products you could draw down one or 200 million tons of CO2 a year still not much however if you're willing to accept that biochar is a possible solution and again many people have problems with it but if we do then a bigger carbon sink becomes available in cement cement currently has a large carbon footprint though that's not guaranteed I've made a whole video about this and if you can make cement in a low carbon way then adding biochar to it can make it more durable and a huge carbon sink we're talking the equivalent of between 200 and 700 million tons of CO2 every year being locked away in new buildings that's the biggest number we've heard so far though it does have a lot of caveats not least of which by CH before we talk about the final way of making cities carbon negative just a brief aside about roofs a question I get asked occasionally is can't we just paint our roofs white and reflect some of the sunlight back and call the planet that way well the answer is yes and the paper finds that doing so could be the equivalent of preventing 8 billion tons of CO2 being released though note that's a oneoff between now and 2050 it's not 8 billion tons every year you can actually also push it much further if you also made roads slightly lighter though that obviously has an upper limit you don't want to Dazzle people the carbon Savings of doing this are pretty good maybe wiping out a few months of global emissions arguably though the bigger reason to do it is the side effect of local cooling similar to trees painting roofs white can cool down the local environment by the best part of a degree but unlike trees you can implement this anywhere you have a roof even on older buildings where a green roof would be impossible anyway that aside the final way the paper proposes making cities carbon negative is well you know how large buildings have heating and cooling systems that also circulate the air well a lot of that air is carbon dioxide two or three or more times atmospheric levels so given that there's concentrated CO2 available in an environment with a system that already circulates air what if we added to that system the ability to absorb CO2 and suck it out of our buildings doing so could remove a 100 million tons of CO2 a year and improve air quality in buildings but that's just capturing the CO2 you then have to safely store the CO2 and keep it stored presumably somewhere out of the city and that will be a lower number than 100 million tons a year this is a form of direct air carbon capture and to be quite honest I'm very skeptical of this as a solution simply put there are better cheaper Solutions available that we've already talked about so hang on a minute between the four approaches Greenery soil construction materials and carbon capture this paper estimates that you could maybe suck a billion tons of CO2 a year out of the atmosphere that's about 3% of our current emissions it's not enough in case it wasn't clear sucking carbon out to the atmosphere isn't how we tackle the climate crisis we do that by reducing our emissions within a city that means changing how we power our systems and heat our homes it me means changing how densely we live and how we move ourselves around it means changing what food we grow and how we distribute it this needs to be our priority but that's not to say that implementing this paper's suggestions is a bad idea because it's not just about carbon we can improve our storm water management connect people with nature improve the health of our soils and our people and cool ourselves down and when we do bring emissions down a billion tons a year will be a big deal by 2050 that might be a fifth of all emissions remaining from all cities it might be what's necessary to bring us to net zero emissions and along the way we can make cities that are more pleasant to live in for us and for other species I hope that the cities of the middle Century look something like this the next layer of history that says to the future we saw the problem and not only did we fix it we made things better as I mentioned this video is based on this paper by Mendes etal kind of translating it into everyday language unfortunately a lot of science is written in language that's quite inaccessible especially if you don't have an education in statistics if you watch a lot of videos like this one are interested in science but don't feel able to read actual scientific papers then I'd recommend this course on exploring data visually which leads on to courses on probability data analysis and modeling you can try this course for free with this video sponsor brilliant.org brilliant is the website and app where you can pick up new skills or support classroom learning in science maths and data science as you can see for yourself their courses are gorgeous and crucially Interactive Learning by just copying stuff out of a book or listening to lectures is nowhere near as effective as learning by doing and the award-winning team of brilliant including professionals from MIT Google and Caltech have built hundreds of courses at a variety of levels that I wish were available when I was at University I've already mentioned their data analysis course but you could also learn about programming large language models or mathematics and as I also already mentioned you can do so for free to try everything brilliant has to offer for free for 30 days visit brilliant.org Simon Clark or click the link in the description doing so you'll get 20% off an

this board was a lot of work but also a lot of fun if you're interested the buildings came from Brigade models and their 2mm range I actually made an extra video going behind the scenes and showing you how I modeled and painted everything which is available right now on my patreon quite simply I would not be able to make these videos without my patrons and especially not a video like this one that took 2 weeks to make they literally keep the lights on here and in exchange they get early access to videos they get access to exclusive content every month notably a behind the scenes Vlog which is some my editor Luke's best work and producer tier Patron and hire whose names you're seeing on screen right now get to vote on a video topic a month and this video in fact was chosen by such a poll

      "transcript": "this might be my favorite board game ever and it does something impossible it accurately represents the climate crisis and is still fun to play to explain how I filmed me playing it with some professional Gamers o if anyone's got a holdy hand what what are those called again the society tag Society tag and with a group of climate scientists I'm worried about Georgia I think we'll use the women's empowerment to destroy the youth climate move [Laughter] this is Daybreak a game from Matt Lok who you may know as the creator of pandemic and Mato menache and for transparency I don't know these creators they don't know I'm making this video I just really love their game in it players take the Reigns of different regions of the world the USA Europe China and the rest of the world and they have lots of tools at their disposal to combat the climate crisis at the start of the game each region is is producing a ton of carbon emissions from fossil fuel electricity generation but also from industry agriculture transport and various other sectors as represented by these tokens the main part of the game consists of turns playing cards from your hands to remove these emissions tokens with each card representing a possible response to the climate crisis ranging from decarbonizing electricity supplies to restoring ecosystems and even geoengineering the cards have tags representing different are of response from social to ecological to energy and a large part of the game is spent playing cards in Stacks to either allow a card's ability to be activated or buffing the effect of a card you only have five slots in which to play cards and you can only activate a card's ability if it's on top of a stack so there's lots of interesting decisions to be made and tradeoffs to be had in how you decarbonize perhaps it's best to show you how the game plays with one of the games I recorded So I borrowed the games night room from Yogscast Studios incidentally if you like board games definitely check out their games night Channel I'm in one of their Warhammer battle reports and I introduce the game to three friends I am playing as the majority World America Europe and I'm China each region has a different thematic starting hand of cards but also a different mix of emissions to manage and will grow by different amounts as the game progresses I think I'm going to discard this card to get one clean electricity and then I'm going to cover this card with this one uh Bri I use my special drawing rights to give you resistance of your choosing you make it sound like magic the Gathering but what I will do is I will tuck it behind uh my reforestation oh which I can do once per turn and I'll will have two to four nature of things we can add a tree so how much have we reduced our emissions by in turn one I got rid of one of mine zero I don't think I've reduced mine none I'm not removing emissions but I'd be gaining a green energy but right now I'm meeting the requirement right now you were but at the end of next turn if you don't meet the requirements I think you can Edge it for a turn okay is that how it wordss it in there yeah I'm pretty sure there the exact wording climate edging as well as supporting decarbonization in your own region players can also play cards to support Global projects which help everyone Often by allowing trade between players and how do we contribute to that Global project so you tuck a card so I actually have a card here that I could tuck underneath but we'd need another one is it looking for specific symbols yes you're looking for the money symbol money symbol I'm going to discard that one instead and I'll tuck my money one under there and players can take actions which limit the effects of Crisis cards speaking of which at the end of every turn all players remaining emissions tokens generate cute little carbon cubes which are added to a global pool some are removed by ocean absorption and photosynthesis and the remaining carbon cubes are added to the global thermometer if you fill a band of the thermometer with carbon cubes the temperature increases by a tenth of a degree uh TOS up what your total emissions are so I've got 25 20 17 oh my god well that's terrifying yep oops but that's our gross missions so the net emissions we need to subtract so seven of the big ones go and then we've got another five can go and another one we've warmed the World by a tenth of a degree and then we've made Sumer Headway to the next 10th of a degree and as the temp temperature on the thermometer Rises more and more negative effects start occurring you roll a dice to represent the chance of hitting Global tipping points such as the Amazon dying back or Arctic sea ice melting once for each tenth of a degree on the thermometer with each Tipping Point having a different effect and you draw increasing numbers of Crisis cards representing the direct and indirect effects of climate change ranging from geopolitical crises to wildfires to pandemics and the interference of the fossil fuel industry which makes players jobs much harder something that happened repeatedly in the game with the climate scientists Dan do you want to flip over the last card fossil fuel disinformation oh god oh no the game continues until either you've played six turns the global thermometer reaches 2° or any one region is engulfed in crisis those are the Bad Endings the good ending is if you can collectively bring the world to Net Zero that's how you win and it's important to note that you all win or you all lose this game isn't competitive it's collaborative in fact coordinating actions between players is absolutely key to Victory something that's very cleverly built into the design of the game so if I'm trying to convey something to you like the idea of global warming rather than having 20,000 cards that people read text on instead can you do it so that the mechanics themselves convey that information there's a massively powerful message for me when I play that game in that the climate crisis is not about individual guilt it's about Collective action this is Professor Sam illingworth of Edinburgh napia University who researches how we can use poetry and games to communicate science perhaps that's something you've never considered before but games allow people who would otherwise maybe have nothing to do with science to learn and have conversations about it unfortunately we have created what I call hierarch of intellect so this idea of I'm I'm not a scientist what do I know my opinion is not really worthwhile so we need to try and break down those hierarchies when we're around the gaming table we enter into a new set of social contracts our behaviors on the gaming table are different from away from the gaming table great example with a terrible game imagine we're playing Monopoly in Monopoly it's expected that I am trying to bankrupt you that is behavior that is morally repugnant away from the gaming table but a contract that we have entered into around the gaming table it means that we can then start to have conversations at a non-hierarchical level that might not be possible away from the gaming table right so we're now on turn two but I can p another tree hey guys China's got a major solar program and we playing this game hang on how far are you taking this I'm so scared for our pet right now yeah well if we were in charge my big stack is regular refrigerants is the single largest way we can reduce emissions as well like as a single solution so that does make sense that yeah that I saw that c of that's so powerful only 10 from China 10 really hang on eight and then what about your electricity ones oh wait those oh I didn't do these in the first round all right well you got oh no no I did is this how it often goes at climate meetings where they're like oh this dirty energy we forgot about the me forgot about that okay so that's all of our emissions okay that's a lot of emissions so basically last turn China was hiding their emissions and then it all came out the next year I really am Ro playing trainer fill that band and we fill that band that's concerning yeah that happened quite quickly to be very clear other games about or set within climate change exist in video games you have Final Fantasy 7 for example but also the Civ series Terror invictor and hathur socialism to name just a few you even have Escape rooms like emergency and of course board games Settlers of Katan has a new expansion about climate change Professor illingworth designed a deck building game called carbon City zero and there's also Evolution and CO2 Second Chance which I really want to check out but in my opinion Daybreak is the best game I've ever played about the climate crisis there's so many little things I love the artwork for one thing all the cards have beautiful art I really like the style even the one on that are associated with negative effects and this in particular I want this on my wall there's no plastic anywhere in the game including its packaging hell the dice are made of sustainably sourced wood each card comes with a QR code that takes you to a page on the game's website that tells you more about that topic and suggests further reading and I love that the game puts all the options on the table it's just clear that some of them are much easier to implement than others rolling out wind and solar for example is pretty easy to do even in the early game while nuclear does generate lots of electricity if you have the tags to actually activate the card decarbonizing electricity is much easier than removing other forms of emissions and you can suck more carbon out of the atmosphere instead of bringing down your emissions and it's much easier to do so through natural means than artificial ones but it's nowhere near enough to offset everybody's emissions and then there's oh I've got a load of geoengineering cards I'll know once per round you roll this Dice and you add one for every geoengineering thing in its stack and then you can effectively negate the amount of temperature bands that we have hit so if we roll well we could actually get rid of two temperature bands but if we roll low we add more crisis cards oh oh I'm trying to yeah do it I think that's too risky personally I don't know what other people feel about that I've got one as well and I agree at some stage I think I'm going to have a machine that that produces a lot of green energy and then I can give it oh you cance people amazing yeah I think I'm going to play my community wind project over universal healthcare which feels very odd let me gain one green energy once per round I really want to get rid of my factory these two cards to remove two factories from my emissions okay so if I do that but I put that up and get rid of the car yeah okay that's two down six from the rest of the world 14 11 from me oh okay these are lower numbers oh it does push us over so it does push us over unfortunately it does mean that things are going to start going a bit worse okay but I mentioned earlier that I also played the game with a bunch of climate scientists from the University of Bristol's climate Dynamics group and I asked them after the game what they thought of how the climate crisis was represented in Daybreak for me personally as a climate scientist it was a bit too much like work [Laughter] I think when you take the climate crisis in isolation this this is an amazing game and I think the the designers of this should really be um you know praised for that I lik The Tipping points a lot there were some things on it that a lot of people may not think about like Tha permafrost I think often gets overlooked also the specificities of like the different tipping points having different impacts so like some are going directly towards you know temperature some are going towards those crisis cards I thought that was very cool I think the major problem I have with it may is that once you reach throw down then you don't have to worry about anything else because the game is over I don't think that's actually a good representation because we should not just stop until we get there we should keep going everything has an effect on everything else so I think that is that is quite realistic I I think the thing that really stood out to me most was the representation of how like the society cards are representative of like 25% of the deck when you're on the science side of it if you're you know during doing climate modeling things sometimes you can tend to overlook the society impacts and things like you know Community ownership that I have here or um circular economy just like things that sort of directly impact people resilience volunteers came in clutch many many times well as did women's empowerment women's empowerment right and so I like that it's a climate game but it's not ignoring the human aspect of it the two I really like so loss and damage if it wasn't obvious this is incredibly flexible card you can use it to mitigate any of these crises in reality it might not be so flexible but it's a a very great thing to have that as a global fund the other one is a bit of a sort of left-wing one but it's this well-being budget and the health of our community is intrinsically linked with with the with the climate change problem and so actually just making a fitter healthier and happier Community would do wonders for climate change so we need to reduce emissions by seven that's all we need to do in order to reach draw down and then we just need to survive one this lot of crises if we can do that I'm putting Net Zero buildings under my stack of community wind which will allow me once per round to gain a green energy and also infrastructural protection this Mega stack is Domina the game of I could give you this one you put it on top and then you can get rid of two bad energy yeah I really need that oh my God amazing just see how much clean energy you yeah yeah yeah ridiculous cuz this discard one card you get two green energies per each solar panel I got three of those so discard one card I get six is everybody finished that's all I can do right so I've got 12 emissions four I have 10 of the big boys we can remove 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight woohoo Okay so we've hit draw down but now we've got to survive this bit we uh roll this dice four times okay ocean acidifications major weather systems and it finally oh no oh no that's here comes the crisy train okay desertification that's fine we get dessert Amazon D okay that that could have gone a lot worse quite tense now displacement Global financial crisis next round doesn't matter Fresh Water Crisis the player with the lowest ecological resilience loses one social resilience okay do that so we survived that round uh-huh that means I think that we've beaten climate change I'm not going to say it was easy yeah it was very stressful I don't think we were making another turn I think Daybreak does something impossible it within the limitations of still being a game accurately represents the climate crisis and what a necessary response to it looks like while still being fun to play that that shouldn't be possible it presents a complex puzzle that is so satisfying to solve and the mechanisms by which you solve it in the game teach you about how we can do the same thing in real life okay what did you think of it as a game I thought it was a stressful game but a very enjoyable game I liked building the big Stacks I liked like changing up the board in the world the crisis was terrifying having to make the difficult choices as well I guess I'll get rid of universal healthcare to get this useful thing in trying to like figure what to prioritize was kind of interesting I really enjoyed it I like that everyone was sort of working together and it's not just you know black and white you do this and it's good you do this there was that element of like oh I do need to you know have some give and take what's I think really good with this game is that everything you're doing does mirror something that actually reflects you know the climate crisis just The Logical nightmare of having to organize all of your cards I imagine is exactly what trying to come up with climate policy in government is like cuz you can't do everything cuz you can't do everything and also it's just so complicated so that matches that quite well in a way sort of like seeing the different tags and the cards and the the things that you're deciding on that helped me kind of realize like oh like like you telling me about the refrigeration like more regulation on sort of things like that I mean it's one of those things it's very easy to be like just start doing this but when you actually look at it you're like oh no there is a lot of like you can't just get rid of one type of energy overnight there's obviously going to be that process in real life our response to the climate crisis will need basically all of the solutions represented in Daybreak and most of those Solutions will require the support of the public through voting for political parties who promis to enact such legislation as such science communication around the climate crisis is key and it can't just be through traditional means like books and TV that's going to leave some communities behind if you want to reach everyone you need to use new formats to reach Niche audiences with information about the problem and its Solutions and games are an important way of doing just that and so originally I was going to finish this video by describing Daybreak as the perfect educational game but when I mentioned this to Professor illingworth he had this to say we don't want to have educational games we do not want edu games we want games that children adults anyone want to play if their own valtion any game that is designed to tackle any topic or any game that's used already exists like for the climate crisis for example we want to have games that are fun and well would you want to play the game again oh yeah yeah definitely yeah i' play this again absolutely now you may be curious to see how a group of climate scientists played this game so we recorded the entire game and it's available to watch in its entirety including some interesting discussion mid game of specific cards right now on nebula if you don't know nebula is the streaming service that's owned and operated by a bunch of video and podcast creators including me it launched in 2019 and since has become the most interesting fastest growing independent video platform on the internet with original programming financed by our subscribers including narrative feature films documentaries game shows and even a play which was excellent I was lucky enough to see it the idea of nebula is that if we as creators can control how our videos are financed and distributed we can both make higher quality stuff and offer a better viewing experience for our audiences by doing away with advertisers you get a distraction fore viewing experience and your subscription instead finances centralized tools for us creators allowing us to become more than the sum of our parts smaller creators get elevated in production value to the next level and all creators get a bit of financial flexibility which we can invest in our passion F projects like this video which took an awful lot of resources and time to make there is a vast library of exclusive original content available on nebula my exclusives include the game with climate scientists several video essays extended interviews with scientists and an entire course on how I make videos about science and that's just my stuff if you want a recommendation from the rest of the library then I particularly enjoy watching Lindsay Ellis's videos if you want to join a platform that is pushing entertainment forwards that is allowing creators to make bigger better projects that they simply couldn't be making otherwise and get access to highquality exclusive thoughtful videos from hundreds of creators then you should join nebula you can do so at nebula.com off nebula.com Simon oxf you also get early access to videos and produce a tier patrons and hire the names that you're seeing on screen right now get to vote on a video topic every month I've shuffled my Patron deck and I draw Liam maty Theo cuz one letter name invites ridicule Colin B and Daniel rafy I'd say that's a pretty solid hand thank you for supporting my patreon if you like the look of Daybreak then I'll leave a link to its website in the description again not sponsored just really like it there will also be links down there to briany ravs and Dom as well as to Professor illing and the climate Dynamics group at the University of Bristol thank you all for being part of the video if you'd like to watch something else from me next then here's two videos I prepared earlier if you enjoyed this video please do pop it a like and maybe give it a share and that just leaves me to say thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

      "published_at": "2024-08-11T10:25:55Z",
      "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the 2048 Olympics here in Athens Greece it cannot be denied not the most impressive Olympics just two records have been broken by athletes representing a little over 100 countries competing in just 23 sports fans here have been nostalgic about the classic Olympics like 2008 2012 and even 2024 back when athletes representing over 200 countries participated in over 30 sports with huge crowds of Spectators watching athletes perform faster higher and stronger than anyone in human history this year small crowds a lower level of performance and even less interest from the public than in the disastrous last Olympics in Manila what happened and how much longer can the Olympic Games carry on this Century we can expect the Olympics to decline in popularity and Prestige and that's a pretty bold statement especially considering how well the current Olympic Games in Paris seem to be going but while there are many factors that will determine the quality of an Olympic Games this Century in this video I'm going to focus on the one factor that will likely override all of them climate change and I'm going to use this depression onitor to keep track of how depressing different sections of this video will be starting here with the most obvious Factor heat as I hope you're aware by now global average temperatures have increased by between 1 and 1 and 1 12° C since pre-industrial times individual years like 2024 are warmer than that though maybe even more than 1 and A2 degrees warmer and individual regions have warmed significantly more than the average for example temperatures in Paris are 3.1 de C warmer at this time of year during the day than they were in 1924 when Paris last hosted the Olympics and you might quite reasonably ask is that really a big deal it's just a couple of degrees well if you're pushing yourself to the highest level of athletic performance yes to explain why here's YouTube's favorite cardiologist slmed influencer Dr Rohan Francis thank you Simon homeostasis is the body's incredibly sophisticated system of maintaining a constant internal environment and humans can actually operate through quite an impressive range of conditions but as temperatures climb that Thermo regulatory mechanism gets harder and harder the two main ways that we cool ourselves down are by diverting blood flow to the skin so that heat can radiate away and by sweating exercise itself of course generates a large amount of heat from your muscles and they can increase metabolic activity up to 15 times the resting rate if the environmental temperature is above or near body temperature you lose that passive Cooling and it's harder to maintain core temperature when core temperature starts creeping up metabolic processes within cells become less efficient more blood flow to the skin and a homeostatic mechanism to reduce that intrinsic heat generation means less blood flow to muscles including the most important muscle there is the oxygen Hungry Heart so performance dips heat exhaustion sets in quicker potentially progressing to heat stroke which can be fatal collapsing athletes are already familiar scenes in endurance events but remember this isn't just about what time of year to hold a specific race but athletes need to train year round so so if the optimum window gets shorter performance will decline unequally affecting athletes in warmer countries for example or those without access to controlled facilities but what about more explosive events like jumps or Sprints where you might think heat would actually help get muscles up to Optimum temperature while less affected than distance Runners and endurance athletes examining the Sprint world records for example show they were as far as I can tell generally all achieve between 18 to 30° C some records have already stood for decades and if conditions worsen fairly soon it's possible they NE may never be beaten many many years ago I was quite a serious Sprinter and even then in that bygone Epoch we all noticed that on very hot days we felt drained even before we'd lined up in the blocks but then again increasing temperatures by a degree or two might negatively impact performance it's hardly the end of the world world right however when it comes to the Olympics specifically it's not just a question of a few degrees because extreme heat events in summer heat waves where temperatures are significantly warmer than average are becoming more common and more extreme due to climate change as the rings of fire report released ahead of the Paris Olympics points out the 2024 Olympics are being held at the same time of year that saw the 2003 heat wave in France where temperatures Rose to over 4 4° C 15° more than the average for August and killed over 70,000 people across Europe the fear was that something similar could happen this year granted the vast majority of fatalities in 2003 were among the elderly but asking athletes to perform in conditions like those conditions that by the way may become common place in European Summers because of climate change will result in more incidents of heat stroke and heat related fatalities that may sound hyperbolic but it's already happening between 2018 and 2022 11 American football players died from heat stroke we got a taste of this with the Tokyo games in 2021 which were the hottest Olympic Games ever temperatures hit 34° C seeing two tennis players retire with heat exhaustion and Russia's Daniel meddev famously saying to the Umpire I can finish the match but I can die if I die are you going to be responsible and away from the tennis court the sand of the beach volleyball pitch was almost too hot to stand on and long-distance swimmers competed in water of 29° C despite starting at 6:30 in the morning researchers at the sabon later describe these conditions as close to torture at the time of recording the Paris Olympics have not been as hot as Tokyo though a heat Dome bringing temperatures to nearly 40° C in parts of France has formed and that has been attributed directly to climate change and that has meant that competitors have had to wear ice vests in order to stay cool and in some sports warm-ups have had to be curtailed and of course the men's Triathlon had to be delayed after Extreme rainfall flushed pollution into the sen leaving it unsanitary can't believe I wrote that generally speaking temperatures have been lower in Paris than experts feared and if they were higher Sports would now enact their heat protocols these vary sport by Sports and a good example is in the triathlon so the ideal temperature for racing would be somewhere in the mid 20s so early 20s to mid 20s is uh the air temperature that is considered ideal for racing for any kind of triathlon be it the short course or the long course that is what is ideal but most of these triathlons now increasing with the climate change have gone to 30 plus degrees there is almost so much that the core body temperature can increase before we start feeling fatigued and the effects of heat one one athlete might might not feel it as much on the cycling but when it comes to running the evaporation or the sweating becomes much more and the impact of the Wind on the body is also less the kind of the cooling effect goes away so the running is when as athletes we feel the most impact of the heat as such the world Triathlon medical team has a modified traffic light system if the event is going to take place in temperatures above 30 . 1° C then the Run portion of the triathlon should be halved in length and if the event is going to take place in temperatures above 32.2 de C then the event should just be cancelled However if those temperatures seem low to you that's because they're not air temperatures they are wet bulb temperatures simply put that's the temperature as measured by a thermometer covered with a water soaked cloth at 100% humidity the wet bulb temperature is the same as the air temperature while at lower humidities the wet bulb temperature is lower than the air temperature because of the cooling effects of evaporation and that's relevant with regard to sweating because as the ambient temperature exceeds body temperature of 37° C which for any Americans watching is about 558 ranking simply diverting blood to the skin for heat to radiate away won't cut it anymore so the body becomes more dependent on the other mechanism of cooling evaporation now some of this is actually via panting but of course most is through sweat maintaining electrolytes and hydration becomes harder but more fundamentally as humidity Rises sweating also loses its function as evaporation declines due to atmospheric moisture levels what's even worse is that as you sweat losing in excess of a liter per hour during intense exercise your blood volume decreases and your plasma tonicity or osmolarity increases is both rendering heat loss by either method less effective and humidity doesn't just mash up your ability to evaporate sweat it also affects breathing I found lots of studies looking at breathing symptoms and physiological measurements showing that people universally report that it's harder to breathe in high humidity and things like respiratory rate uh goes up but I'm not sure we fully understand why yet it does seem to cause Airway swelling especially in conditions such as asthma but but it might also be a property of how easily we can utilize the oxygen in the air so overall when atmospheric temperature is higher than body temperature and humidity is very high as well the body can no longer effectively regulate its temperature without some external assistance both of these are relevant to athletes now back to everyone's favorite Warhammer influencer and general per of bad news Dr Simon Clark now the bad news warmer air can hold more moisture that's just thermodynamics and over the past half century we have seen the global average specific humidity go up and the next of century we're going to see that Trend continue which combined with Rising temperatures will result in higher and higher wet bulb temperatures for athletes to compete in the humidity was part of what made the Tokyo games so punishing for the athletes they were competing in humidity of nearly 70% resulting in wet bulb temperatures above 32° something that mercifully hasn't happened in Paris this year at least at the time of recording but this issue is only going to get worse the conditions in Tokyo will likely become the norm athletes will need to perform in ever more punishing conditions resulting in a degradation of the average quality of performance at the games especially affecting endurance events and it's not just going to affect the athletes if athletes are going to be performing at a lower level that's going to make the games slightly less exciting to watch athletes won't be jumping quite as high or running quite as fast fewer records will be broken and team sports will have to use slightly less Dynamic exciting strategies that will make the games slightly less appealing as will the increased number of Errors made by officials forced to endure the same brutal conditions but you know what's going to make the games much less appealing having to sit or stand in those conditions for hours at a time as an audience member it is possible to somewhat mitigate this as we've seen in Paris but I think it's quite likely that as the summer games heat up we'll see a gradual decline of audience members for non-air conditioned events there's going to be less Buzz around these events which unfortunately means there's probably going to be less funding available for highlevel athletes like a lot of funding for most of the sports comes from The Spectator pool that we have it all comes down to you know how weather Chang is impacting the number of people taking Sports and then how many people are actually interested in viewing the sport because that is how most of the sports get their money and this is where we need to leave the stadium or the road or the pitch or the beach because the Olympic Games themselves are just the final part of an athlete story and they don't get there without years and years of training and hold on to your hats because this is where we find out how this thing goes decreased audiences and interest means less funding will be available to athletes but so will the fact that the 21st century is going to see Rising costs of adapting to our new warmer more extreme climate sport is going to drop down the priority list many places will become so hot or so frequently hit by extreme weather events that it will be difficult if not impossible for athletes to train there and these two factors together mean that only the best supported athletes from the richest countries can afford to travel to train at the top level for any kind of weather condition be it cold or warm you if you train in that kind of weather that you're going to finally race in the most optimal results are achieved like you can give the best out of your body so I think that is definitely a concern like most of the countries wouldn't be able to afford something like this there will be a decrease in the diversity of athletes at the games and a decrease in the number of countes represented and those that do attend are still training in more challenging conditions and more susceptible to being disrupted by extreme events like wildfires droughts and storms India is a developing country right now and they can only fund so many athletes at the grassroot level the support is almost minimal it's like a chicken and egg story that you know you get so much support if you perform and how do you perform you need support and this isn't even to mention the fact that climate change is expected to increase the number of International conflicts this Century see our video on the century we saved Earth for an example of how and that's going to divert even more funding away from sport or the fact that by the mid-century around a dozen countries currently represented in Paris probably won't be inhabitable anymore when are we going to see the last Olympic delegation from the males or the martial Islands but perhaps most depressingly of all in a world where it becomes too hot to play outside in the summer fewer and fewer children will be involved in outdoor sports and events like the marathon and the triathlon May well disappear from the Grassroots up I've already been seen that a lot of kids are not physically active and a that is because of the weather B that is lack of facilities that are being available and C that is also because a lot of digital kind of sports have come into the scenario like video games so I think feather has the biggest impact that as parents also they're concerned that if their kids go to play in this warm condition they might fall sick so I think there is a big impact of number of kids going into physical activities if the pool gets smaller at the very start at the grassroot level then how will the heroes be created like you know how will Champions be recognized this paints a really Bleak picture for highlevel athletics this Century especially for those events that take place outside and that test endurance the results could well be a 2048 Olympics similar to what I described at the start of the video fewer countries represented fewer Sports lower level less attention but hold on just a minute compare the 1924 Olympics to the 2024 Olympics international sport now looks completely different it's much more organized better supported by national bodies and the technology available to athletes is simply incomparable the 100 m freestyle world record for men was 59 seconds in 1924 and just 46 seconds in 2024 that Improvement was made possible by new training techniques improved understanding of physiology and new technologies being used in swimwear in caps and in goggles as I said at the start of the video climate change will likely be the dominant Factor on international sport this Century but other factors still exist new technologies will be developed that will help keep athletes safe and maintain their level of performance new forms of media will rise up that will keep people interested in the games and in international athletes the games themselves can also adapt new heat protocols can be brought in events can be rescheduled to cooler times of the day as they already are and some even advocate for the Summer Olympic Games to be entirely rescheduled to a cooler time of the year though doing so will likely impact athletes training regimes the Paris games for their part have made headlines for their sustainability efforts setting a carbon budget limiting new construction and using 100% renewable electricity though those aims have come under a lot of criticism by academics for basically just being greenwashing citing a lack of specificity and transparency and an overreliance on carbon offsetting the games have also come under criticism for accepting sponsorship from polluters such as cocacola Samsung and Toyota that though it is worth noting that there are no sponsorship ties whatsoever with any fossil fuel producing companies fossil fuel sponsorship is still R in international sports however with national Olympic teams like team GB and the Australian National Olympic team accepting money in exchange for positive PR from companies such as British gas Hancock prospecting shell and others to quote the rings of fire report that I mentioned earlier if sport is going to take its sustainability and environmental commitments seriously to minimize the climate change impacts experienced by athletes and Spectators during sporting events it will need to conduct a radical reassessment of its relationship with fossil fuel companies athletes are in a bind here funding is hard and will only get harder to come by and fossil fuel extraction companies are offering it but to accept such deals is to accept a deal with the Devil rehabilitating the image of and extending our dependence on fossil fuels sport is a story of IND indviduals making tough choices and prevailing against the odds it could be a fantastic example of how Society can move past fossil fuels and instead Embrace a more sustainable future and if athletes and Spectators take a stand and boot fossil fuel companies out of sport then we increase the odds of sport as we know it surviving bringing down our emissions limiting our damage to the climate will the 2048 Olympics really look like this have the Olympics peaked and will now face a decline maybe the challenges facing International Athletics in maintaining the current level of competition in running large events and most importantly in keeping athletes safe are immense but the tools at our disposal for making that happen are also immense sport brings people together in a way that basically nothing else does and the Olympics are perhaps the most awesome thing that we do as a species I predict that people aren't going to let that go without a fight oh and for completeness I thought I'd close by talking about the future of the Winter Olympics I made a diarama normally I end these videos like this showing you the names of the patrons who made this video possible and imploring you to join them at patreon.com Ox Fizz but because this video was about the Olympics I thought we could do something a little bit different it's not an Olympic event but welcome to the patreon marble race if you would like to become a patron of this channel then you get early access to videos you get exclusive content every month including a behind the scenes Vlog every month that some of my editors best work and producer tier patrons and hire get to vote on a video topic a month also executive producer patrons as well as Steven Spielberg and Henry cavaler patrons get their names up in lights or at least in the video and congratulations to the gold medalist Alina Dima with Soo Silvera going to Angelo and shameful shameful Bron going to Yan thank you so much to pragna and to Dr Francis for chatting to me please do check out rohan's YouTube channel it's linked down there in the description he makes phenomenal videos when his job as a consultant cardiologist allows and thank you very much for watching if you would like to learn more about this topic then please do read the full rings of fire report and I can also recommend warming up how climate change is changing sport I'll leave links to both of those down in the description if you'd like to watch something else from me next then here's two videos on screen I prepared earlier and that is pleas me to say thank you for watching I'll see you in the next one"

      "published_at": "2024-08-01T10:30:33Z",
      "transcript": "ending climate change requires the end of capitalism we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is the money you are absolutely going to see more climate activists call for anti-c capitalist practices and Market regulation and I believe in capitalism but we don't necessarily use it correctly or it's broken in some very important ways capitalism amongst a lot of climate activists and environmentalists the word capitalism has become a sort of four-letter word in fact maybe you should bleach that like capitalism but what's the alternative are we just supposed to abolish capitalism what does that even mean why can't we just fix it and hey what even is capitalism anyway hi I'm Hazel there AKA Hazel is online I spent four years in school learning economics and then another four unlearning it and if you're expecting Simon to be here on his own channel well he's taking July off as a sabatical to build his new studio so I'll be your economics substitute teacher for the day now just because Simon's gone doesn't mean you're allowed to just start acting up in class okay do not try me I'll leave a note and if you like this video there's more where that came from on my Instagram Tik Tok and new YouTube channel so capitalism can it save the planet well as you might guess by the color of my hair and what I'm like as a person I have some thoughts see the point environmentalists usually make about capitalism is this in a profit-driven extractive system that chews through both people and the environment to make a quick buck we can't just sit and cross our fingers and toes and hope that maybe one day corporations will wake up and suddenly decide to care about the environment so what's so wrong with capitalism anyway in theory capitalism should be perfectly efficient companies should compete to be the most coste effective and eco-friendly and clean energy should compete to be the lowest cost Fuel and the Invisible Hand of the free market should be able to you know crank down the thermostat but instead the Invisible Hand is punching the climate right in its invisible face There's No Business incentive to save the rainforest or the whales or the biosphere that allows human life to exist under pure free marketon capitalism a tree isn't worth anything until it's been cut down and puled and not only that but our current system of capitalism requires those profits to grow every year we need to pulp even more trees every single year or else the pulpy is going to go out of business and if companies don't make more money every single year the economy doesn't grow and if the economy doesn't grow that's what we call a recession so what exactly do I mean by there's no incentive for companies and rich people to just clean up their acts and switch to Green Technology well to understand that you need to understand externalities here's a little example imagine you live in a nice quaint town by the river let's call it Rivertown I don't know I'm an economist not a writer anyway in Rivertown you drink drink the river water your kids play in it you fish from it and life is good but suddenly a company opens upstream and starts dumping sewage into the river you don't want your kids and your fish to be covered in poop so when the crap starts to flow Downstream your town has to spend thousands of dollars cleaning up the company's mess but since sewage R Us makes thousands of dollars dumping the sewage they keep doing it and you have to pay the cost not them this is called an externality the company has no reason to stop dumping or to spend any of its own money cleaning up its act so why would it might as well pass your externality down to the town and to make things worse if it costs you more money to clean up the mess than they make making it the entire economy loses money economists call this a market failure and scientists call it climate change because instead of Rivertown it's all of humanity and instead of sewage it's civilization threatening Planet torching greenhouse gases isn't economics fun we don't live in pure unregulated free market capitalism the government is supposed to be the referee and if it was doing its job it would force the company to clean up its mess either by taxing it and giving the money to rivertown's Cleanup Crew or just regulating it and telling it to knock it off but suddenly sewage RS is using all of its profits to donate to the pro sewage politicians campaigns and buying Billboards that say sewer water is good for you actually and telling you that cleaning up the sewage would ruin the economy and you're right back where you started covered in now hypotheticals are fun and all but this is exactly why big polluters especially oil coal and gas companies are not being held accountable for the amount of damage they're doing to the climate the externalities in our economy are not being internalized now don't get me wrong we are making progress under our current system clean energy is getting cheaper countries are decarbonizing it's just not fast enough and it's blocked at every turn by polluting companies some economists argue that if we're really really going to tackle the climate crisis it's not enough to just regulate or tax a couple of companies or Industries we would have to change our economy so that it doesn't need to continue to grow and Gobble up more and more natural resources and pollute greenhouse gases every single year nothing grows forever some economists think that those of us who live in rich countries like Canada or the UK or the USA yeah suck at USA you're in third place now how's it feel we in rich countries already have enough stuff we are productive enough to provide for everyone's needs and we could actually make less stuff if we wanted to and lower our GDP as long as we distributed resources and money more equitably and efficiently this is called the degrowth movement and this might seem absolutely crazy what you want us to have less money what kind of economists are you but it turns out once countries get rich enough higher GDP per person stops corresponding to higher standards of living happiness and life satisfaction so it is theoretically possible for a rich country's people to live better even if the economy shrinks and produces less stuff under our current system of capitalism GDP the measure of all the stuff produced by an economy needs to increase every year or else you get a recession which means companies need to make more stuff every year how do you make more stuff by cutting down trees burning more oil mining more minerals and that means that the flip side of GDP growth is more emissions and more climate damage clean technology and energy exists and it can definitely help emissions stay the same or even go down as GDP goes up this has been done occasionally but usually usually higher GDP means more Productions means more emissions and climate damage globally the growth of emissions has slowed compared to the growth of GDP but it hasn't gone down so can we do capitalism without a constantly growing economy maybe there's a whole lot of disagreement some argue that maybe a reigned in government regulated version of capitalism can work some argue that we need to Pivot to some flavor of socialism and of course there are plenty of economists who think that we can continue growing the economy as long as that growth is green but even they think that we need to put significant restraints on big polluting companies they say that the problem isn't growth itself but maybe May it's just growth in all the wrong places like my face in high school maybe the problem is unequal growth or inequality another interesting little feature of global capitalism is that some people are filthy rich and some people are broke now we could argue for ours and I have about whether there is a right amount of inequality but I don't get invited to those sorts of parties anymore whether it's between individual people or countries the people who are most economically vulnerable will suffer the most from climate change and the rich will disproportionately make climate change worse cuz under the kind of capitalism we're doing right now the rich get richer and the Richer they get the more they supercharge climate change inequality makes climate change worse I mean it kind of makes sense middle class people take trains rich people take private planes Oxfam shows that the top 10% richest people cause half the climate change and also earn half the money in the world loads of Studies have found direct correlations between emissions and income inequality one study even showed that a 1% rise in inequality correlates with a 1.4% rise in emissions from electricity in buildings so good news bad news bad news is we can't just install a couple solar panels and keep the economy Trucking just the way that it is the good news is the way to effectively combat climate change through economics just so happens to improve most people's quality of life especially the part about decreasing wealth inequality when you look at the data the countries that have lower wealth inequality also have higher happiness scores and standards of living and they also often just so happen to have lower emissions so let's take a look at these Wonder countries and find out what we can learn from them so I looked at the rankings for the highest income equality the largest decrease in emissions or just the lowest emissions and the highest happiness scores and I found which countries all had that in common and oh would you look at that it's the Scandinavians and the Netherlands and New Zealand all these metrics happen to be biased towards Rich developed countries so I added a couple of countries that are developing but punching way above their weight class in all three of these metrics that is Uruguay Costa Rica and Bhutan these countries are all carbon neutral score very highly on happiness and life satisfaction indices and have fairly low inequality scores so what do they all have in common social safety nets Uruguay has a saying NAD is M NAD no nobody is better than anybody else so 90% of Uruguayan seniors have pensions the state provides cash transfers to low-income families and has strong Public Health Care and public education you also see this in the Nordic model Which prioritizes social safety nets and public services that anyone can access whether they're rich or poor all these Social Services decrease income inequality which we know means less emissions number two strong democracies in the US there's like two parties in the UK and Canada we technically have a few but like let's be real we have two in Sweden there's eight the reason Nordic countries can get away with this sort of half socialist half capitalist system is because so many people trust the government to regulate properly because they feel like their votes and their voices matter and number three strong commitments to get off fossil fuels in New Zealand 87% of electricity comes from clean energy now all of us can't be surrounded by an ocean to turn into Hydro power but every country has a unique opportunity for green energy generation New Zealand just happens to be smart enough to harness it and also they have a taxpayer funded TV show where comedians do spelling bees and if that's not an indication that their democracy rocks I don't know what is great gu but I'm so sorry that is a comma these countries all tax emissions incentivize clean energy and prioritize their citizens well-being their governments act as functioning referees to prevent unfettered capitalism and corporations from ruining the planet and you know their citizens lives but that's not what you asked me at the start of class you asked me whether we can solve climate change under capitalism and I'm not going to pretend to have an answer to that the truth is that none of us live under purely capitalist or purely socialist systems the economy is controlled by a mix of government and corporations and everybody else just in different amounts in different economies like I haven't even gotten to the fact that governments literally give taxpayer handouts to fossil fuel companies is that capitalism I haven't even mentioned that the climate crisis turbocharges inflation by destabilizing global trade and Supply chains can capitalism survive that the Wonder countries I mentioned earlier are certainly further to the Socialist side than most but they also just have well-functioning democracies that can pass smart policies and regulations it's true that the current system of capitalism that we have is not working for us but as we can see from the Wonder countries they all have elements of capitalism plus the government providing programs to reduce inequality acting as a referee to reduce externality caused by big polluting companies they have a lot of public participation and Trust in their governments so that big polluters can't just bribe their way into not being regulated their people are happy and their emissions are decreasing and that is not a coincidence so whether you overhaul the system completely or just modify things a little bit to be in line with the Wonder countries everybody agrees on a few things this economy isn't working for the planet and it's not working for everybody we need Global cooperation and smart policies that reign in the power of big polluting corporations while taking care of people and the planet governments around the world need stronger policies that protect people's well-being and the climate so what next well you can find out what those policies and solutions are and demand them from your government whether it's your city councelor or your prime minister and I just so happen to talk about those over on my channels plug now feel free to discuss quietly amongst yourselves but if you hey hey got the chatter out there hey all right that's it I'm telling Simon"
