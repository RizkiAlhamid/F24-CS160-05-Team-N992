    "transcript": "every four years Americans across this great nation put our differences aside to join hands and collectively lose our  minds over the presidential election turn out for what we think drun drun they're eating the dogs now we've seen some pretty crazy stuff in recent years but if you're thinking 2020 was the most Hog Wild election in modern history you have absolutely got to hear about what went down in the year 2000 cuz if you're some kind of rless jenzy damn daning shees Lord you may be surprised to hear that in the year 2000 there was a literal and verifiable stolen presidential election and even if you're over the age of 30 and maybe remember hearing something about hanging Chads and Florida recounts the details are certifiably insane and if nothing else it's good to just remind ourselves of the fragility of elections in the United States and why your vote Yes I'm talking to you really does matter in shaping the next four years and hell I'll say it I'm crazy maybe even Beyond hi I'm Raleigh Williams a guy with a climate science and policy degree and a raging obsession with an election that happened almost a quarter of a century ago and this is a video about stealing a presidential election welcome to climate town [Music] in the year 1999 a significant portion of the country genuinely believed that when the date rolled over from 99 to 00 all of our computers would self-destruct launch the nukes and Destroy America's economy it was called Y2K and it was a dumb thing to be afraid of but in their defense in 1999 computers looked like this [Music] but the New Year came and went and with Y2K safely in the rear view mirror Americans could focus on the two things that really mattered the hit single who Let The Dogs Out by the baham and who let the dogs out and the 2000 presidential election choose your character in the blue Corner was Al Gore he cut his teeth as a Democratic senator from Tennessee before becoming vice president to a saxophone toing sexual relations with that woman denying president by the name of Bill Clinton Gore released a bestselling book about global warming in the environment back here in 1992 he released the award-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth that supercharged climate change awareness here in 2006 but here in 2000 he's running for president today I announce that I am a candidate for president of the United States and in the Red Corner is George W bush not to be confused with his father and the president from eight years earlier George HW Bush George regular W Bush was a Texas oil man who founded an oil and gas exploration firm then became the co-owner of the Texas Rangers and then became the governor of Texas and in the year 2000 he's the Republican candidate for president we will renew America's purpose it's Gore versus Bush it's climate Guy versus Texas oilman it's election 2000 and it's right now the and if you're wondering why they're all so focused on a big big map it's because America doesn't have a simple democratic election where the candidate with the most votes wins we have the much stupider Electoral College where states are assigned Point values and each candidate tries to win the highest Stakes board game on earth and that means close elections can often come down to just a couple of states that could swing either way way but remember this is also a TV show which means networks are foaming at the mouth to call States as early and often as they can filling up the map and making politics feel like Wheel of Fortune George Bush he carries his home state of Texas Washington State goes for Gore Sarah you hit the jackpot with1 million and then at 7:49 p.m. eastern time NB BC felt they asked enough Floridians exiting the polls who they voted for and they were ready to make the call so sure interrupt you Mike you know I wouldn't do this if it weren't big Florida goes for Al Gore it was massive Florida had 25 electoral votes and if Gore took it the bush path to Victory looked rail thin the other networks followed suit and it seemed like a wrap then and there except it wasn't a wrap because as actual voting data replaced exit polling data Gore's lead began to shrink and something positively weird was going on because Florida polling stations were inundated with voters calling to say they were confused about the ballot and they were worried that their vote might have gone to the wrong person curious then 2 hours later at 9:55 p.m. NBC News is now taking Florida out of Vice President Gore's column and putting it back in the too close to call column as the other states fell into place only Florida was left undecided which means who ever won Florida would win the election then at 2:16 a.m. roughly 6 hours past their target demos bedtime Fox News Now projects George W bush the winner in Florida and thus it appears the winner of the presidency of the United States the other networks followed suit and Al Gore was left sitting in a hotel room staring at every major News Network in the country telling him he had lost an election that all the exit polling data said he had won so Al Gore picked up the phone called Bush to concede and then left left to go deliver the official concession speech the thing is Al Gore had not lost the presidential election yeah and he would have known that if he had thought to call his own numbers guy Michael hully who is keeping careful track of the Florida vote he said we're at the war memorial and I asked why and he said we're about to concede and I said for what we haven't lost the whole thing was a cluster in a number of ways but most importantly it was so close that it had automatically triggered Florida election code 102.1 141 legally requiring an automatic recount of all the votes in the state this election was not over but Al Gore didn't know that and was literally walking to the stage to concede the election when his senior adviser David Morehouse ran his ass down and stopped him the drama imagine that moment I wish I had a clip of it I don't but I super wish I did luckily HBO made a made for TV movie about the 2000 election and it did include this goofy ass reenactment no no no Mr vice president Mr vice president Mr vice president Mr vice president Mr Vice President sir I'm not going to keep please please Mr Vice President there's a problem with the numbers in Florida and then in the most awkward phone call of his entire life Gore called Bush back to UNC concede as you can imagine Bush was pretty pissed the conversation got heated and Gore apparently ended the call with something to the effect of I don't care what your little brother says this isn't over and that's a pretty badass thing to say it's also a little confusing but in this case it makes perfect sense because George Bush's little brother is Jeb Bush and in the year 2000 Jeb Bush was the governor of Florida I told my brother that we were going to carry Florida for him is that going to be a truthful statement it better be so the race moved to the Sunshine State where the 5.8 million votes cast in Florida would be machine recounted to see if Bush's 1,784 vote lead would hold and as the computers rescanned the votes Bush's lead steadily shrank down to just 327 votes but that's not all there were an additional 171,000 ballots that the machines had just skipped because either they couldn't read any Vote or they read multiple votes which makes sense if you remember the many many many calls on election day about confusing ballots and defective equipment these are the same computers that we thought might fire nuclear weapons at Russia if they weren't sure what year it was good thing Florida state law says we'll take these 171,000 ballots and recount them by hand right Florida law and the law in many other states calls for a careful check by real people of the machine results in elections like this one but team bush had a slightly different take they wanted to not count any more votes and declare George Bush president immediately and in situations like this you'd hope there'd be someone to step in and say get we're counting all the votes I'd even settle for a simple sorry but counting votes is how democracy worked and that person should have been Florida Secretary of State C Harris now in a wild coincidence the co-chair of George Bush's Florida presidential campaign was also a woman named Catherine Harris and in an even Wilder coincidence it was the same person that's right both the Florida governor and the Secretary of State in charge of maintaining the Integrity of the election had actively campaigned for George Bush which is a really hard position to be in if your Al Gore luckily he did have one thing going for him he got more votes in Florida than George Bush did that's right we now know for sure that Gore got more votes in Florida than Bush by kind of a lot unfortunately some serious problems with Florida's voting system invalidated literally thousands of ballots that would have gone for Gore [Music] good God people this election is a mess first off thousands of Voters across the whole state of Florida showed up to the polls and found they're not allowed to vote that's right newly elected governor and longtime little brother Jeb Bush oversaw a purge of the voter roles that accidentally included a lot of legal voters who overwhelmingly voted to the Democratic he looked at the role and he looked at me and he said we have a problem you're not on the rooll sorry about that now down here in Palm Beach County they used a ballot with such bad graphic design that thousands of democratic Jewish voters accidentally voted for the alt-right anti-semitic candidate Pat Buchanan the Democrats were listed second I punched the second hole and that second hole was for Pat buan and this is not just like my opinion man here's Pat Buchan himself if the two candidates they pushed were Buchanan and Gore almost certainly those are Al Gore's votes and not mine and as if printing your ballots on a bunch of godamn origami cranes isn't bad enough voters up here in Duval County were instructed to vote on every page of their ballot but anyone who followed those instructions had their vote invalidated cuz there were two pages of presidential candidates and these aren't just like a couple of votes in Florida there was a vote for Gore on 84,000 of these invalid multiv vote ballots compared to just 37,000 multiv vote ballots that included Bush but the bush legal team was prepared to swear on their mother's lives that a bunch of elderly Jewish Democrats had voted alt-right and that the multie ballots were uncountable because technically there's no way to tell for sure who the voter was trying to vote for not even if the candidates were Al Gore and also popular writing candidate Al Gore you want to be ideologically pure do you want to win they said we want to win and under the time pressure there seemed to be no practical way for the gore legal team to contest any of those multiv votes The Accidental Buchanan votes or The Purge votes that's thousands of votes Flushed Away man but wait because there was a ballot issue that they could go after in some counties voters have to punch out little paper Circle known as Chads it sounds simple but sometimes that Chad hangs on for dear life and other times that Chad recepticle fills up so godamn full that you can't punch yours out at all now you got yourself one of the thousands of pregnant or dimpled Chad ballots that never got counted but since these Chad stricken no votes could indicate just one candidate the gore team set their sights on hand recounting ballots with pregnant or dimpled or swinging Chads and in doing so though ushered in a dynasty of just the absolute hacki as talk show jokes I had to go to the doctor today you know why I have a hanging chad and so the entire 2000 presidential election basically came down to 61,000 ballots in Florida that machines thought were blank would they be counted or would they be thrown away we'll find out next time just kidding let's find out right now the gore team struck first by requesting recounts in just four heavily Democrat counties where they thought they'd uncover a boatload of dimpled and hanging chad ballots with Al Gore's name all over them the bush team immediately sued to stop the hand recounts on the grounds that Gore was selecting favorable counties Gore counters in a televised address I am also prepared if Governor Bush prefers to include in this recount all the counties in the entire State of Florida Bush ignores the offer and doubles down in the lawsuit to stop the four recounts but loses the case and the recounts Are a Go Point Gore but the bush bench is deep they had to let the recounts start but no one said they had to let it finish so Secretary of State and team Bush MVP Katherine Harris tightened the recount deadline and Republicans worked to slow down the actual vote counting itself they argued over every vote vote for six Republican party challenges four more votes for Gore election supervisor Jane Carroll a Republican voted against this count they had to shut down the accounting temporarily because the canvasing board members had to run to court to go appear before the judge to talk about whether or not we were eating Chads Katherine Harris then attempted to stop the entire hand recount early I've decided it is my duty under Florida law to exercise my discretion in denying these requested amendments but was denied by the Florida Supreme Court undeterred Katherine Harris follows up by stating she won't accept any recounts unless they're completely finished in the next 3 days the gore legal team says hey you can't do that and the Florida Supreme Court steps in and says stop  around and gives them a week to do the recount there was only one question left on everybody's mind who let the dog sorry no who would win this election with the recount in full swing things looked very good for Gore he picked up 93 new votes in vucha county and if their projections were right Gore would win another 3 to 400 votes in Palm Beach another 100 in Miami Dade and up to 500 in Broward County even on the low side that would be enough to put Al Gore right back on top pretty good news for the Democrats the Republicans on the other hand weren't about to let a lead slip away they devised a new method to ensure none of those votes got counted in Miami dat a young Roger Stone had teamed up with other Republican operatives and while the hand recount was happening on the 18th floor of the Clark Center building a hoorde of what appeared to be angry Floridian protesters stor wared the building stop the count stop the fraud an instant Classic this horde of men in suits banging on Windows and attempting to disrupt an American presidential election would become known as the Brooks Brothers riot after one of Gore's lawyers was chased down and harassed for the crime of having a sample ballot in his hand the Miami dat canvasing board felt sufficient threatened and they had had enough they stopped the recount and if you're wondering if this was a spontaneous bunch of protesters or some kind of group of Republican operatives trying to steal an election for their team here's a picture I think can really answer that [Music] question no recount means no change in votes from Miami dat but sure the Palm Beach County votes could go Gore's way right yeah they could have if they had finished the recount but since Katherine Harris was Secretary of State she was able to move the Palm Beach County deadline up a day to the Sunday after Thanksgiving um so the secretary of state has apparently decided to shut us down with approximately 2 hours perhaps left to go um and that's how she chose to exercise her discretion we believe there are approximately 800 to 1,000 ballots left to come um so unfortunately um at this time we have no other choice but then to shut down the supervisor for elections needs to uh hurriedly uh gather all the paperwork and prepare to file the returns that we have um we certainly don't want to get anything in there at 501 Palm Beach submitted a partial recount and Katherine Harris gave me old two for flinching and rejected it for being incomplete once again Al Gore would get none of the newly counted votes and it looked like this whole refusing to count votes in a democratic election was a real winning strategy for team Bush I hereby declare Governor George W bush the winner of Florida's 25 electoral votes for the president of the United States but not so fast Jackson cuz team Gore knows how to play the hits they filed yet another lawsuit and the Florida Supreme Court decided that they weren't going to let a bunch of computers that looked like this and George Bush's two best friends decide who got to be president Court shall order a manual recount of all undervotes in any Florida county where such a recount has not yet occurred the Florida Supreme court ordered a hand recount of the entire State cuz they weren't about to let Florida be the butt of everybody's jokes for the next 24 [Music] years that's right it's the Supreme Court of the United States and under the flimsiest of legal pretext they've decided to take Bush's case rather than let Florida complete a legally mandated hand recount of their own votes the five Republican appointed conservative justices closed ranks and voted five to four to stop the count and end the election officially handing the presidency to the guy who both lost the popular vote and received fewer votes in the deciding State five to four huh so you do understand democracy and as if to admit that they shouldn't have stepped in to subvert an election the five conservative majority Supreme Court ruled for possibly the first and only time that this decision was not precedent it would only apply in this one case so let's all just forget about the time a conservative Supreme Court stepped in and stopped an election that was actively counting votes and handed it to the Republican and there have been some incredible think pieces written about this whole Affair but possibly the best quote comes from the dissenting opinion of Justice John Paul Stevens although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election the identity of the loser is perfectly clear it is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law and that is how the US Presidency ended up in George regular W Bush's hands in the year 2000 honestly it's a pretty depressing story and you might even be wondering why I decided to cover it well here's the thing it's a presidential election year once again you probably wish it wasn't and after hearing me smash through all the ways the 2000 election got absolutely borked by some little brothers and a bunch of the guys from that scene in Wolf of Wall Street you might even find yourself thinking what's the point in voting when these dudes can just come in and swipe an election but here's how I see it the biggest problem with the 2000 election was that it was too godamn close sure this kind of thing is exciting as hell is this the dagger but this is the election for the president of the United States and when we're trying to finally double down on the biggest pieces of climate legislation ever we don't want a buzzer beater we want to win by 40 we want a blowout we want to light the scoreboard up so hot it becomes self-aware like in the movie Space Jam but I'm not out here trying to advocate for voting for the climate on Vibes alone baby so we teamed up with our friends over at Evergreen action to take a look at what the actual climate Stakes of this election are and why you getting yourself registered to vote and then actually going to the polls is 100% worth your time now obviously I cannot predict the future if I could I wouldn't be making YouTube videos I would be out predicting I don't know what it would be but I know I would get it right but thanks to the predictive modeling of a nonpartisan energy and environmental policy firm called Energy innovation we can get a pretty good approximation of what our climate future might look like here's their projection of greenhouse gas emissions in the US based on three scenarios in Gray we have a business as usual model that takes into account the federal policies we've currently got in place such as the inflation reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law as well as energy Trends and Technology costs notice the general downward trend of the line that kind of levels off around 2035 now let's take a look at another line This orange line is the emissions projection for the climate and energy policy recommendations from Project 2025 if you've never heard of it project 2025 is a sort of policy playbook for a potential Republican president in this case one Donald Trump it was spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation and about a hundred other mainstream conservative organizations and it contains a ton of specific climate and energy policy goals that energy Innovation was able to plug into their model to get a pretty scary look at an American future under project 2025 it includes stuff like increasing liquefied natural gas capacity increasing crude oil production repealing the inflation reduction Act and the infrastructure law that kind of thing now this may just look like another regular old line but energy Innovation projects that path would dump billions more tons of carbon dioxide into the air which would lead to some pretty disastrous climate outcomes not to mention the Litany of other problems that come from burning tons of fossil fuels it's been you looked at me project 2020 5 has been getting a lot of press lately mostly because it feels like conservative groups are finally saying the quiet part out loud and it's freaking a lot of people out project 2025 advocates for things like unchecked Presidential Power the elimination of the Department of Education a gutting of the EPA and of course a desire to how do they phrase it if the American people elect a conservative president his administration will have to eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere after all that came out project 2025 became a bit of a political liability that Trump has tried to distance himself from I don't even know those guys but I'm pretty confident we can use the policy recommendations in Project 2025 a document specifically crafted for Donald Trump by the Heritage Foundation as a pretty good approximation of what another Trump White House could look like because roll the clip the critical job of Institutions such as heritages to lay the groundwork and Heritage does such an incredible job at that encourage new thinking Embrace new directions and keep Heritage at the Vanguard of the conservative movement I think tremendous things are going to be coming out of Heritage and there's also this Heritage Foundation president somebody else doing an unbelievable job and of course who could forget his comprehensive energy policy plan we will drill baby drill yeah but there's also a third line and fortunately for us it's one we can actually get excited about because of a president came into office and oh I don't know actually tried to be a climate Leader by enacting the kinds of policies that Evergreen action has been nice enough to jot down in their Evergreen action plan 2.0 we could get this third line a deep sultry Blue Line a line that gets all the way down to Net Zero by 2050 I mean good God that's a nice looking line but what can we do to make our reality look more like that really nice line great question we take sweet sweet action we build a clean and effective National power grid we decarbonize the industrial sector we modernize and Electrify our transportation systems we Electrify our homes and commercial buildings we make polluters pay for the extensively documented messes they've left behind and more and this is one of those scenarios where you don't even have to care about climate change to benefit being a climate leader means leaning way into a clean energy transition we'd be building out every part of an updated clean energy system and that means a  ton of skilled well-paid union jobs renovating and strengthening the grid improving our public transportation networks building out electric vehicle charging infrastructure generating clean energy The Works we're also looking at lowering overall energy costs as better power generation Tech comes online and phases out the current technology of light things on fire or smash them till they explode Believe It or Not hauling ass towards a clean energy revolution could actually save Americans money on their monthly energy bills according to energy Innovation enacting an evergreen action plan 2.0 style policy could save the average household almost $300 a year by 2030 compared to the project 2025 plan being a climate leader is also about rebuilding and strengthening underserved and unders supported communities with worker and Community programs it's also about holding fossil fuel companies accountable for making a big mess and then not cleaning it up and all of this is only possible if we elect a president who's going to push for climate action by enacting bold climate policy like a national clean energy standard and investing in clean American industry and we're definitely not going to get anywhere near net Zer by 2050 if our main plan to deal with climate change is to just eradicate climate change referen from absolutely everywhere but the cool part is if we get this right it could go really great we could actually build the future that people are excited about we've all heard of horrifying tipping points that lead to climate catastrophe but there are also positive tipping points caused by proactive climate action the right mix of policy Solutions can align climate the economy environmental justice and labor incentives and cause massive decarbonization through the rare and coveted spiral into control and look I wish we had another 4 years to burn before we need to get moving okay I wish we didn't have yet another most important election of Our Generation but we do because 2050 is really fuing close to give you a sense of how close it is Who Let the Dogs Out by the Baja men was released in the year 2000 that's 24 years ago that means we basically got one more who let the dogs out before it's 2050 so if you're sufficient bought in which I think is a reasonable assumption considering you just listen to two dozen minutes of me yell at you about hanging Chads in the electoral process it is critically important that you get yourself registered to vote and that you vote and when I say vote I mean vote for kamla Harris and Tim Walls that's right I Raleigh Williams a guy with a YouTube channel called climate Town who has a master's degree in climate science and policy I'm officially in favor of the candidate who might actually do something about the climate crisis and honestly I kind of make it a point not to get too endorse in these videos but the guy thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax to stop American manufacturing and I am not saying that a comma Harris presidency would be a lock to get to net0 by 2050 it's still going to take a ton of work but with some good luck some good policy and some good advocacy we could have an actual good shot at some genuine crisis averting climate action and if you want to do something right now you can make sure you are registered to vote different states have different registration deadlines so it would be extremely Raven of you to go check your voter registration status online click the link down in the description to see if you're registered to vote already and if you're not register right there congratulations and now you can lean into this doing your whole civic duty Thing by checking out the Playbook that our friends over at climate change makers put together one shockingly effective strategy is handwriting nonpar in letters and sending them to voters in swing states with a vote forward campaign if you're curious check them out Link in the description but whatever you do just make sure you've got a plan to actually pull the lever or punch the hole or fold the origami or whatever okay we're voting climate up and down the ballot bring some friends with you make a whole trip out of it okay let's vote so hard that we win by 40 because the closer it is the more chance these people get to decide who gets to be president all the more reason to carefully and as a group vote for the climate I'll leave that up to you to determine what I'm just kidding that means to vote Harris walls obviously obviously okay that's the end of the episode thank you so much for watching if you liked it smash that like button destroy the comment section and put the Subscribe button in the trunk of an old car and roll it into a lake and hit that little bell icon too if you like what you saw and you want to support us the best way to do that is through our patreon page we just revamped it we got a gaggle of behind the scenes footage we do Town Halls episode q&as and even access to the climate Town land line that's this phone that gets actual phone calls sometimes patrons will call in to try to leave a message and suddenly find themselves talking to me because I picked up and now we're both wondering was this really the best use of both of our time so if that sounds like fun to you join the patreon page pitch over all right big thanks to our partners over at Evergreen action check out their Evergreen action plan 2.0 using the link in the bio get that PDF and go to town on those details and a special thank you to Ben Phil and Kylie over at ethic for letting us use their green screen for that Jim Kramer Mad Money election bit that we did you remember that it pretty fun lot of shouting we've also got some great t-shirts and a podcast and a newsletter and a Discord server and we linked them all in the description check them out and let me know what you think call me even I'll be right here we did it y'all check right now to see if you registered to vote seriously do it right now love you okay okay I have not tried marijuana uh I have never used it at any time [Music]

    "transcript": "hey I'm here in Los Angeles California it's a City full of people who are way hotter than me but they're almost all dead inside it's in the eyes there's just nothing in there not unlike the LA River it's a Bonafide movie star but it's polluted to the core from Decades of chemical spills pesticide infused runoff and the burned out rubber from 95 takes of this scene from Greece but if you're not from Los Angeles you might find yourself thinking that doesn't look like a river at all this is a river this is a river river dog River but out here in the American West a historic drought has made it very hard for these lifeless hotties to remember that this is almost no water at all and it's not just Californians the more than 40 million people in the American West served by the famously overused Colorado River are being asked to conserve this water by any means necessary historic water cuts to multiple States shutting off the water while you're brushing your teeth taking shorter showers cut back on their water use beinging in the shower that's going to save you a couple of plushes and save you a couple of gallons get a weapon and fire it into your lawn but no matter how much water they conserve there's not enough to go around so where is all the water going well if you look at the 1.9 trillion gallons of Colorado River water consumed by people every year a very unfortunate Trend occurs according to a study from 2020 all the water people use for drinking swimming pools watering their lawns slip and slides and any other private consumption accounts for just 12% of the water use golf courses office parks and all other businesses are just 4% of water use and weighing in at 79% of all the water we use is agriculture which is crops and that might make sense if it was crops for people but the vast majority of water we use in the American West goes to grow food that people do not eat 56% of all the water in this river goes to animal Agriculture and one animal above all others so who's taking all of America's water the cow not this cow in particular but the United States is home to 87.2 million cows and the food those cows eat requires so much water it's creating a real ship storm for people who want that water for drinking running cities making energy basically just stuff we need to do to live and it would be one thing if we were blasting through our water supply because the citizens of our great nation decided that's how they wanted to use it but the rules for who goes thirsty and who gets to flood a literal desert were written over a hundred years ago and are based entirely on the unbreakable Ironclad law of dibs they consider dibs so sacred that a single family in California whose grandfather happened to start a dairy farm near Palm Springs in the 1920s gets more water than the entire city of Las Vegas the people in this part of California get more Colorado River water than all of Arizona and Nevada combined and if that sounds like a stupid way to manage a critical resource just wait until you hear about the foreign governments Who currently have the right to use an unlimited amount of groundwater from America's deserts and are exercising that right to send cow food back to their own deserts so as our supply of water is being decreased by climate change which it very much is and our demand for water is being increased by a growing population of both people and livestock we should probably find a way to be a little more efficient with our water use and regardless of your feeling on cheeseburgers I think we can all agree that it's generally a good practice to just pop the hood on how we're using one of our most critical resources to see if there's anything that can be learned from it hi I'm Raleigh Williams a guy with a climate science and policy degree a little Sparkle in my eye and what I can only imagine is foot conjunctivitis and this is a video about who's taking all of America's water welcome to climate [Music] town to understand why we're so hellbent on growing animal food in America's deserts we got to go back to the thrilling conclusion of the Civil War the US had just been hot glued back together and people were free to enjoy their beloved pastimes of making horses run fast honky baseball and uprooting the entire family and building a new life somewhere else but where to go well what about this part I mean why the hell does nobody live there besides the people who already live there but I'm sure they'll move so the US hired a guy named John Wesley Powell to do a Geological Survey and they crossed their fingers hoping Powell would come back saying there's a ton of water everywhere and everything's ready to pump and grow Powell spent two decades studying the Colorado River and the West overall and then came back to Congress in 1890 with this Ripper of a map truly look at this map beautiful colors incredible detail and the breakdown of the watersheds imagine trying to make this map with without computers or satellites or colored pencils it would be per near impossible unfortunately Powell found that there was just not enough water to settle the west and if you wanted to get even a few people out there it would make more sense to create Federal dams to stabilized water access and to Define your political boundaries by water flow regions instead of by arbitrary state lines you know cuz water is such a critical foundation for life and all the indigenous people who already lived there knew that and had extremely effective water conservation techniques dating back to 10,000 BC including sometimes being nomadic because water comes and goes in the west and you need to be able to follow it unfortunately that wasn't really going to fly with the settlers who preferred to get hundreds of Acres of their own private land that no one else can touch and you can't tell me there's not unlimited water for my free land and as you can probably imagine the US government didn't listen to a single one of Powell's warnings and just wait saved settlers West like a third base coach in an exciting game of honky baseball too soon for a call back I just said honky baseball you know what cut this part and if you're watching this and you're thinking well obviously this John Wesley Powell guy didn't know what the fck he was talking about because I've got a cousin in Arizona and they have a swimming pool in their backyard that's a reasonable thing to think but first consider the phrase credit card debt and let's keep going among the places settlers flocked to was just the straight up desert including the bone dry Imperial Valley California which gets just 3 Ines of rain on average per year and has more sun in the winter than any other place in the US it's also in the movies that's what you get Welcome To Earth up until 1901 the Imperial Valley was a Barren uninhabited place because fing of course it was it was the desert but nowadays it looks like this it's been one week you looked at me that's because the US dug a canal to divert water from the Colorado River into the south side of the Valley and the Imperial Valley was not alone the US government damned and canaled and borrowed whatever they wanted from the mighty Colorado to suit the needs of the settlers who wanted that water and since water was the single most important resource for these thirsty Western settlers they made it their absolute beeswax to dibs as much water as humanly possible after all this is free water you get the rights to Forever you would have to be an idiot not to try to get as much as you possibly could and so a dibson spree for the Colorado River commenced Farmers got a couple million gallons a year here a couple million gallons a year there but I mean there's two trillion gallons of usable water in that son of a how could we possibly run out of water he asked less than halfway into a 30 minute long video yes I am hopeful for one of our favorite Publications Grist did some excellent reporting on this link in the bio and found this quote from a 1960 US Supreme Court case I am morally certain that neither in my lifetime nor in your lifetime nor the lifetime of your children and great-grandchildren will there be an inadequate supply of water as the population of California exploded the other Western States got scared that Golden State farmers would would dibs too hard and take all the water this is kind of a legitimate concern because the law of the river stipulated water was allocated based on first in time first in right and California was about to call shotgun on all the water before they'd even seen the car which is not allowed California you have to be able to see the car it just makes it more fair but instead of deciding on some kind of equal distribution mechanism the western states double down on the dib system with a nationally sanctioned dibs in 1922 Colorado Arizona California Nevada Utah Wyoming and New Mexico sat down with Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover and hammered out a deal that would split the river in half hamburger style giving upper Basin States 7.5 million acre feet per year and lower Basin State at 7.5 million acre feet per year now I know you know obviously but an acre foot is the amount of water it takes to submerge one acre or about 3/4 of a football field in one foot of water so you know kind of a lot of water an acre foot is about 325,000 gallons of water and the Colorado River compact do out 15 million of these little guys to the seven states sounds great one problem the Colorado River does not have that much water they drew up the Colorado River compact during some extremely wet years and despite knowing there were only 14 million acre feet or less for consumption they figured it would just be a problem for future American to deal with thanks guys they also completely cut Mexico out of the initial compact only to attack them on later by inventing a bunch of water that didn't really exist and also also they didn't even pretend to equitably include indigenous people but you probably already guessed that didn't you oh and another problem water rights are hierarchical which means senior rights holders get their entire allotment before Junior rights holders even get a drop and even if senior rights holders wanted to conserve water and send the rest down the line they kind of can't because water rights are subject to a use it or lose it rule see in an attempt to prevent people from dibsy a bunch of water only to turn around and sell it to the highest bidder you'd only get to keep the rights to water that you actually used and if you think about this for an extra 10 seconds you realize it's an excellent way to discourage water conservation if a farmer decides to use less water or develop a less wasteful irrigation technique that farmer is rewarded with having all of his extra water taken away forever ah you thought I wasted that water uh-uh bucket try to keep up anyway farmers were also banned from selling their unused water allotment as part of the government's attempt to avoid water speculators so if your dad's dad moved to the desert and called dibs at the exact right time your family might Now find itself with 84 billion gallons of water every year and a strong in incentive to use every last drop and it is this little quirk in America's water law that got so many desert dwelling Farmers into the cattle feed business that's right it's time to talk about Alfalfa Alfalfa is prized for having a lot of easily digestible protein and if you're trying to support a dairy cow blasting out hot high protein milk it's a damn fine option for feed beef cows tend to eat a lot of other stuff but they'll also suck down Alfalfa with the best of them when they get a crack at that good green before researching for this video all my Alp Alpha knowledge was about this little but I've pushed all that information out to make room for this Alfalfa now it's your problem as a crop Alfalfa fuing loves the Sun and can grow for 5 to 7 years with way deeper Roots than normal row crops also if you can keep the sun shining on it year round you can get 10 to 12 harvests per year out of the same plant but unfortunately Alfalfa also needs a lot lot of water so you're probably thinking this is one of those classic trade-offs Ratatouille loves to cook but he's got to be sneaky about it or else his little rat will get shot alphaalpha loves the blasting Sun but it's got to be sopping wet basically all the time so you got to compromise right wrong yes Alfalfa is also grown in other less Aid parts of the US but those places are nothing compared to the yields you can get if you have two ingredients a full-on blasting Desert Sun year round and a ridiculous amount of water that you have to use they have so much water in that part of the desert that a lot of alphalpha fields have traditionally been flood irrigated which conveniently for us is exactly what it sounds like you hook up a hose and make a fun little flood for your crop friends until they're soaking in an inch or two of water some of that water goes into the soil some floats up into the air and some runs off into another Farm or maybe all the way to the salt and sea a body of water filled almost entire irely with excess irrigation water from the Colorado River and by the way we're currently out on a farm in Long Island this is not the kind of farming we're talking about in the video we mostly just wanted like a farmy kind of background so that it wouldn't bump too much with the other parts of the video this is a place called Young's Farm they do excellent work here thank you so much for the location now pretend you're back in the American West another benefit of alphalpha is it can be grown year round alongside potentially higher value seasonal crops got a couple extra acres and a bunch of water to use blast them Jackson Alfalfa can also withstand short periods of no irrigation then pop right back so you could drop the water demand in the summer then bring back the same stand of alphalpha into production when there's more water available it's honestly a pretty good crop it just requires a  ton of water and uh not to ride his coattails too hard or anything but my main man John Oliver did a whole Last Week Tonight about water a couple of years ago and found this excellent clip from an Arizona alphaalpha farmer interview roll the clip of them rolling the clip just listen to this farmer in Arizona explaining why he chose to grow a particularly water intensive crop well I just been farming it this Alpha alha you got to keep farming it to keep the water and that's why I was mainly doing it was to hang on to the water in the Imperial Valley alone alphalpha fever has led to the projected use of 2.6 million acre feet of water from the Colorado River this year and according to reporting from propublica in the Desert Sun most of that water apparently goes to just 20 families in the valley who have such senior water rights that they aren't subject to the same constraints as nearby cities propublica and the Desert Sun even made some excellent Graphics about it and here they are right now that's just one section of the Colorado River if you look at the upper part of the river that includes Colorado New Mexico Utah and the one with the hor Show everybody's parents are obsessed with that land is mine you see that fence that's mine that fence is mine this feels mine that fence down there that's mine too spinning some B and in that region 90% of agricultural water is turned into cattle feed I'm sweating into my own eyeballs yes we do feed some cows for fun sure but the vast majority are fed so they can either blast out milk or be mysteriously killed and turned into beef and I know it seems like treating an important resource like it's worth nothing and will never run out seems like a strategy that wouldn't have a downside but folks it has a downside as the population and farming operations grow and they're removing more and more water for showering drinking and growing crops in the desert we started writing checks that our asses couldn't cash and we simply do not have the water for the activities we want to use it for the Colorado River and its reservoirs have dwindled to alarmingly low levels St George Utah is running out of water Dry River beds depleted reservoirs canals and fow fields and also climate change has snuck into the party and is making everything worse in the back near the bathroom the worst Mega drought in at least 12200 years yeah they say climate change has fueled wildfires and threatened the economic security of farmers it's endangering the security of ener and Water Resources for nearly 6 million homes and businesses across seven states one study from UCLA found that Rising temperatures between 200000 in 2021 have led to a loss of 30 million acre feet of water from the Colorado River Basin which has combined with the drought which is also probably tied to climate change to leave the massive reservoirs along the Colorado dangerously historically low the reservoirs are so low that even a massive smash of snow pack over a winter or two doesn't come close to refilling the reserves which means this may not be an example of a classic drought this might be aridification while a drought is temporary and we'd expect a full rebound aridification means the area will be permanently drier with less water available and while the American West is particularly susceptible to a drought we certainly don't have a monopoly on it and I don't want to hit you over the head with it but that means that the climate might be changing which means climate change I'll say it I'm crazy I'll say climate change right to your dang face I'll say it at dinner right to my uncle and we won't talk for 6 years but if the Colorado River water rights are too complicated the federal rules around how much groundwater you can pump out of private Wells are a whole lot simpler there aren't any groundwater is water that collects in giant underground aquifers over the course of hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions of years regulation of groundwater is usually left up to the States but they tend to be pretty loose with the laws and that's not me editorializing States like Missouri literally brag about having quote the loosest water laws in the country where water users have the right to under most circumstances use as much water as they would like and for whatever purpose they see fit back in the Civil War days when honky baseball was already starting to get boring great call back yes the government didn't really understand how or why groundwater flowed in in modern days we Now understand that aquafers take thousands of years to recharge but back then we thought it was maybe unlimited Infinity water I mean it didn't even matter at the time because groundwater was dozens to thousands of feet below the surface why make a law about water that we didn't even have the technology to get to by the 1930s our craftiest Engineers had figured out how to drill down and pump it out but instead of making laws to regulate it we had already established the sort of no shirt no shoes no problem policy and to this day groundwater is free and Unlimited in most places one of those places is most of Arizona where you are free to pump as much water as you like out of their underground aquifers which are doing just fine I'm sorry I'm hearing that should be declining at an alarming rate and it's here that we get a sense of just how little of a America gives about its water because what do you think happens when you pump too much water out of an aquafer uh-oh did you just Google it cuz that's cheating and cheaters never win but also if you went online to find a news article about groundwater you may have found more than you barging for that's right I'm talking about bias lucky for you there's ground news yes sir ground news is an independent website and app that gives you an easier and more data- driven way to read your news every story comes with a visual breakdown of the publication political leaning reporting reliability and ownership allowing you to see potential journalistic conflicts before you're telling a room full of people that Rudy Giuliani can do a kickflip you want an example yeah I bet you do did you know that the Oklahoma State superintendent just mandated that the Bible must be incorporated into public schools for kids from fifth grade all the way through graduation let's check it out right away you can see that over 150 news outlets reported on the story of these 25% lean left while only 19% lean right huh you can also compare headlines to see how bias can affect framing the Western Journal frames this as Oklahoma righteously putting the Bible back in schools while National zero focuses on the Oklahoma education secretary threatening to revoke teaching licenses for not incorporating the Bible different ground news also has my personal favorite feature the blind spot feed where you can see stories that the Publications you usually read might not cover did you hear about the Pope new swimming pool not that but you know stuff like that you got to check it out for yourself ground news helps you think more critically about how news is spreading and who's probably reading it which helps you better understand our increasingly divisive world and that sounds pretty damn good to me and if you're thinking what I'm thinking I encourage you to check out ground news and yeah baby we got a discount code for you I'm talking ground. news/ I think back slash but I've never really been able to tell the difference climate Town that's the important part ground. newclimate toown or just click that link in the description and get 40% off the Vantage level subscription which gives you access to every single goddamn feature on the app that's $4.99 N5 a month which has a well-known $5 a month bias thank you and now back to climate town and the thrilling answer to the question what do you think happens if you pump two much groundwater out of an aquafer you run out of water and it doesn't come back the more water you pump out of the ground the lower and lower the water table gets this leads to a phenomenon called subsidence where land slowly caves in hellmouth style the more you pump the deeper you have to drill your well until eventually you run out of water it's a lot like putting all your bills on a credit card it feels incredible for a while but sooner or later it's going to catch up with you and the way I know this is because it's happening right now in Arizona people in laaz County Arizona who used to have functioning groundwater Wells are waking up to find that they now have a very deep very dry pipe in their yard because let me tell you about the AL marai Dairy from Saudi Arabia as of 2018 it has been illegal to grow Al Alpha in Saudi Arabia without getting too far into it Saudi Arabia pumped the out of their groundwater from the late 1940s until a couple of years ago and in that time they used up Approximately 80% of their fossil groundwater they needed to look elsewhere for the most precious of resources and due to the United States's loose groundwater laws that meant buying land in Arizona and just taking America's ground waterer so they bought 15 square miles of prime Arizona desert drilled deeper in the aquafer than the tyes and farmers in the county and dangerously lowered the groundwater level by pumping up as much water as they wanted for Z Freedom it would seem is free and if you're wondering how much water Saudi Arabia pulled out of the ground you're not alone the Arizona state land Department sent a memo to at least ask them to measure how much water was getting pumped out because they were worried about groundwater depletion as a result of agricultural leases in the butler Valley but unfortunately the Arizona state government at the time wanted to be cautious of tangling with a powerful company and the metering request was denied but I mean come on how much water could Saudi Arabia possibly have taken and I don't presume to know how the people of laaz County Arizona feel about this but luckily I don't have to because there's a recording of them explicitly saying how they feel about this thanks to the top tier journalism by a publication called reveal you're saying it's perfectly legal for these people to come in here drain the aquafer and the local people have to redrill their Wells that they've lived there for years we got to move on but yes it is it they're not breaking the law now Saudi Arabia shipping alphalpha back home sounds pretty bad until you remember that the number one exporter of alphalpha with more exports than all other countries in the world combined yes it's the United States it's not always the United States in sentences like that but like nine times out of 10 it is and yes a ton of those exports come from the most water constrained parts of the Colorado River Basin you want to hear something really wild in the Imperial Valley after they harvest that flood irrigated alphalpha for the 12th time that year 12th lft that's a obstacle course of a word whatever it's more expensive to send that alphaalpha to cows in another part of California than it is to cram it onto a cargo ship and send it off to two of the biggest alphaalpha importers in the world China and Japan and if you're wondering how that could possibly be cheaper here's a fun little factoid you can tell your friends the US Imports more stuff from China than we export so there's a constant stream of shipping containers Coming to America full and going back empty China and Japan are eating an increasing amount of beef and dairy but rather than use their own precious Water Resources they can buy and ship American livestock feed like Alfalfa across the Pacific for next to nothing cramming those otherwise empty cargo ships full to the brim with compressed alphaalpha hay and I don't want to be overly dramatic but this basically amounts to exporting water water that we apparently really need in the Arid West and I'm not being overly dramatic because this is exactly what a bunch of much smarter and more informed people than me have already said I'm just saying it way louder than them also big shout out to Arizona Water expert Professor Robert Glennon for all the help he gave us on this episode he wrote this incredible book unquenchable you should totally read it Link in the bio as well as a bunch of other articles and another book how many books have you written is it zero books would zero be an accurate count I I'm sorry I don't know where that came from I think this son is permanently cooking my brain uh let's wrap this up the United States is currently in the middle of a serious Water Crisis that we are treating very UNS seriously we haven't updated our Western water laws that we cobbled together to help 1900 era Farmers settle water disputes without shooting each other and now those laws have metastasized our available river water is decreasing due to climate change but rather than reward conservation we're incentivizing Farmers to use all the water they possibly can our groundwater is being pumped out faster than it can be replenished but rather than regulated or even measure it we're giving it away for free with a purchase of a little bit of land our credit card debt is coming due and our reaction is to continue spending so what are we going to do about it well step one is to stop incentivizing the misuse of water and in some ways this is already starting to happen Arizona governor Katie Hobbs has canel one of the leases Saudi Arabia was using to pump unlimited ground water and is set to terminate three more in the coming year which seems like a win until you remember that American companies are doing the exact same thing I mean even Arizona's state pension fund has invested $175 million in a Wall Street company that's buying up land in Arizona for groundwater access and the pension fund only stopped when some people found out and push them to divest so yeah state governments need to rethink how they regulate groundwater and you can get involved by joining some of the local and state groups that are pushing for stronger or any legislation even pushing the government to measure not stop not cap measure how much groundwater is being removed would be a good start but a much more powerful fix would be to readdress the system of double Stampy no erases water rights that got us into this situation in the first place unfortunately this is not a simple thing to do because for the most part water rights holders are just Farmers trying to make a living sure there are a few Monster Mash sized Farms but there are thousands of struggling Farmers out there and if we charged them an extra million dollars for their water or just took it away that would be a real dick move it would also be an excellent way to starve America because that's where the food comes from and a lot of food is mostly water if you're tempted to think about this like a farmers versus City problem and that farmers are taking too much water just remember they're not using that water for slip and slides brother they're using it to grow crops and livestock that people in cities eat most Farmers aren't wasting their water they're deciding what to grow based on what they can make from the market and what the current water laws are but still water conservation's got to come from somewhere and if you're looking at the same charts that I am a pretty obvious place is cattle feed when it comes to the Colorado River if every single person and business in every major city shut off all their water valves you would only cut 177% of the water demand but again it's not that simple unwinding the law of the river would constitute a seismic shift in American Agriculture and honestly I have no idea how that would look but there are some actionable steps we can take to address water shortages most regulations require rights holders to allocate all the water or none of it and loosening some of these archaic policies could allow Farmers to conserve their water use through more efficient practices like like drip irrigation then sell their extra water the money from the extra water could even go to help fund some of those expensive drip irrigation installations so you know that's pretty nice the inflation reduction act has also earmarked a few billion dollars to help with the Western Water Crisis and it seems like about a billion of that might go to pay Farmers to follow their fields to save water is that the perfect solution I don't know but it is something and while cities and industries are just a small percentage of water use in the west we're still talking about trillions of gallons that means conservation efforts like not demanding every house in America comes standard with a Kentucky Bluegrass lawn AKA one of the largest irrigated crops in America now you may be saying well grass isn't a crop we don't eat it  exactly another way to conserve is to install lowf flow appliances and fixtures in buildings and houses as insane as it sounds the city of Las Vegas has actually been making a huge effort to conserve their water as are a lot of other cities in the west one study found that as population grew by 24% in the 28 urban areas they looked at overall water usage dropped by 18% which is pretty cool and if you're looking to get involved in an organization that works on these problems you are in luck my friend our buddies over at climate change makers have put together a Playbook that you can use to contact your local representatives to urge them to take action on water conservation through the upcoming farm bill so if you're looking for a policy solution solution to push forward check it out Link in the bio it's technically a description but I say bio so whenever I say either one just know that that's in the text below this video but the Big Mac father of all of them is probably to stop demanding and consuming so much meat and cheese and I know times are tough right now and those two items account for a lot of people's favorite food I'm not in charge of you you're the boss of your own body I will say that if the principles of supply and demand to be believed Farmers wouldn't use as much water to grow cattle feed if we didn't consume so much beef and dairy it takes literal hundreds of gallons of water to produce a single pound of either beef or cheese so a collective effort to reduce our consumption would actually have a big effect and I don't know what that means for you maybe it means going meat and dairy free for a few days a week or trying a plant-based meat alternative or any number of replacements for the current status quo of flooding a desert for cow food and in case you're thinking Americans are just hardwired to eat beef and there's simply no way to change that I guess I would point you to the fact that industry groups are constantly spending money trying to convince America's children to eat more meat and this should really be its own episode but if we all naturally eat beef then why are industry groups so hellbent on getting Pro meat propaganda into schools if everybody was just naturally drinking a bunch of milk all the time why would the dairy industry need to hire actual director Michael Bay to make this insanely highquality milk commercial and that was the Vienna wood dancing D and now let's make that random call with today's $110,000 question who shot Alexander Hamilton in that famous duel all right let's go to the phones and see who's out there hello hello for $10,000 who excuse me on let mil I'm sorry maybe next time got milk good Lord that is an awesome commercial imagine being so good at making commercials that they give you the Transformers franchise you get way more into the characters of the robots this time they're so good they're always doing the right thing they're always doing good and I think people like that and also for the kids out there there was a time when not everybody knew about the life of Alexander Hamilton before Linn Manuel Miranda nobody even knew that Alexander Hamilton was a rapper and this is just my personal opinion man but if everybody really liked milk you wouldn't have to make an ad about it milk is famous everybody knows what milk is just let the people decide if they want to drink milk leave me alone milk Kramer what am I drinking milk oh conclusion music we're home free baby okay if you take away just one thing from this episode it should be to think a little bit more about how the world uses its water now if you're concerned about your personal water usage it's a good idea to consider all the ways you use water and not just when you turn on the faucet or Blast Your Lawn water used on your behalf is also a big factor and that's influenced by a lot of things including what you eat and some archaic ass laws from the 1900s that you probably don't have a lot of control over okay that's the end of the episode I probably could have gone on for another hour about this but every episode has to end somewhere and I guess this is that somewhere there are a ton of other climate issues with animal Agriculture and I swear to Christ we're going to get to them we figured we'd start with water on account of how water is the thing that makes all life work and speaking of water big thanks to teato AKA Western water girl for all of her help with the research on this episode if you're looking to learn more about the Western us water shortage you simply must check out her videos seriously no notes 10 out of 10 go check them out also thanks so much to Young Farm on Long Island for letting us get a bunch of farmy looking shots they're doing great work out there we also bought some pies on our way out and let me tell you those Pi kicked ass ooh and all this pie talk has probably got you thinking do we still have a patreon page you better believe we do but something has changed something has shifted that's right we got an official climate Town phone line and now hot crackers if you're a patron you can call me not all the time not just any old time that would ruin my life okay there's going to be specific times you can call me and if you don't hit one of those times you can leave a message okay it's supposed to be for fun don't with me all right there's also a bunch of other fun perks on the patreon page we've also got a ton of fun perks on the patreon page like behind the scenes footage Town Halls a patreon only Discord Channel discount tickets to the live shows and a bunch of other stuff the patreon page is the backbone of climate town so if you like what we're doing and you want to support us patreon is a great place to do it we've also got t-shirts they're made by a company called TS designs in North Carolina and sent to you by the good Folks at ethics merch we made a whole episode about merch that you can check out but to summ it up these are nice shirts that are made entirely in the Carolinas with a fully transparent supply chain that actually pays workers a living wage if you want one of our very nice t-shirts you can buy one using the link down below we've also got a podcast called the climate denars Playbook hosted by me and my childhood friend and Daily Show writer Nicole conin and executive produced by Ben bolt and we have a newsletter that me and climate Town writer director Matt Nelson Wright there's links to all that in the description below that's the end of the video and I've been waiting quite a while to do this okay okay I have not tried marijuana uh I have never used it at any [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] time did you hear that pop goodbye"

    "transcript": "fashion is a powerful force in the modern world you think you're just throwing on your favorite band shirt but really you're now walking the streets in a magnet that attracts a few people you want to talk to and about a hundred absolute weirdos who haven't had a consensual conversation in over a decade seriously though buying and wearing merch can be a great way of supporting something you care about merchandizing and the t-shirt is everything I treasured that shirt I love that shirt but the problem with merch and the vast majority of modern clothing is that it's being made to be thrown away and that's not an exaggeration most of today's clothes are being manufactured for dirt cheap using terrible labor standards and lowquality materials and being shipped thousands of miles to stores around the world only to be worn an average of seven times before being discarded and ending up in a landfill and that's if they get worn at all because we are landfilling unused merchandise at a staggering rate and if you're wondering why all that unused merchandise doesn't just get donated to a thrift store a lot of it does but due to the sheer volume of clothing we produce up to 90% of donated clothes get rejected and chances are it'll end up right back at the dump with its friends it is now so cheap to make merch that companies will order thousands of shirts give away as many as they can for promotion and then trash whatever they've got left there's actually an industry term regarding branded merch they call it brandville which is exactly what it sounds like and I don't normally like puns but for some reason that one really pops but I don't want to sh on selling merch altogether it's one of the most consistent ways for bands and entertainers and content creators to make any money now that streaming services have absolutely destroyed album sales musicians are finding it a lot easier to make $15 selling one shirt than they are scraping together thousands of unique listens at less than half a penny per play now I may not be a singer songwriter fun guy to talk to at parties but since merch is a good way of getting the word out about your stuff we wanted to make some climate Town t-shirts when we found out about the mountains of disposable merch and the emissions and labor violations associated with it we decided we could feel okay about it by finding a supplier who sources their materials responsibly and pays their workers a living wage the thing is we simply could not find that person it was crazy we spent literal years looking around and not making merch but then we found a way to make shirts that we feel pretty good about we think could be a template for other people who want to make merch too are they perfect probably not but we figured we'd make an episode about the process and the overall problems with merch as we try to figure it out ourselves and maybe there's a way to make merch that doesn't feel terrible or maybe not you be the judge hi I'm Raley Williams the guy with the climate science and policy degree and the proud new owner of 846 climate Town t-shirts and this is a video about the heaping pile of garbage that is merch welcome to climate town [Music] now there was a time where if you heard a song you liked it probably sounded something like this then you just go home and have a nice long think about it that was being a music fan hey remember the time we heard that song that was pretty great but then they figured out a way to let you buy the record so you could hear the song at home what you're going to hear about today is nothing short of a miracle living stereo played on a record and that went well for a while but now everyone was so godamn addicted to music that they needed something more what' you do wrong this time pop they needed all their friends and family to know exactly what kind of music they liked they needed merch and back then it wasn't just t-shirts who heard you love Elvis friend how about some Elvis gum Elvis bracelets Elvis shoes maybe even some Elvis hound dog orange lipstick oh you hate Elvis fantastic here's a pin that says I hate Elvis or maybe you love The Beatles now beetles shirts are cool but you could also have a wig here's a lunch box how about some bobbleheads I'd like to get 1,500 I'd offer you like 200 bucks by the 1970s ACDC supposedly made more money selling merch than from selling tickets on their world tour and notorious face paint Enthusiast Jean Simmons is still talking about all the money he made from Kiss Merchant we outsell The Beatles and Elvis combined no other music Act of any kind has ever done as many chachkas as we have I'm hungry the idea of merch has expanded even further in the past few decades and has grown to include serial monstrosity coronation flakes in honor of the latest vampire who will get to be driven around the Streets of London but there is no more dominant item in the history of the multi-billion dollar merch industry than the T-shirt gas they are so popular that they become hilarious punchlines in famous comedy t-shirts I saw blank and all I got was this lousy t-shirt and of course been there done that got the T-shirt Bazinga they've even expanded Beyond bands to include TV shows movies government agencies pharmaceutical companies family 5Ks Bachelor parties and more an Alo Bloom of custom t-shirt companies exploded in the internet age and now there are thousands of companies is eager to take care of all your merch needs in minutes you can get multiple designs in a dozen colors and sizes all manufactured printed and shipped wherever you want want to sell them online no problem they'll even set up a website where anyone who wants your custom shirt can get it shipped straight to their house that's how easy it is and you can do it all for $5 a shirt [\u00a0__\u00a0] wild and all of this might have been fine if it weren't for the hilariously devastating problems with how we manufacture modern clothing we actually did a whole video about fast fashion I recently rewatched it and honestly it holds up pretty good so give it a watch if you feel like it Link in the bio but there are a few important points to hit in order to make this video work and to make sure it's not boring let's deliver them in the style of a classic BuzzFeed list welcome You've Got Mail now this will come as a shock to exactly nobody but there are a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton of fully documented human rights abuses in the fashion industry the only thing more impressive than the sheer number of violations is the variety of abuses which include but are not limited to unsafe working conditions including over a thousand deaths in a single Factory collapse forced labor modern day slavery that's what rights groups say is going on brutally long hours sexual harassment child labor Jim how old are you and so much more to make a thousand custom shirts for 4.95 a shirt you're going to have to cut costs and that almost always means paying the people who make the shirts an absolutely unlivable wage just imagine paying someone to grow and harvest cotton paying someone else to process it and spin it into thread paying someone else to sew the shirt together paying another person to dye the shirts sew the tags on and a print killing it at a graphic from season 3 of The Walking Dead does that sound like the kind of thing you can pay someone a decent rate to make and still sell for [Music] [Applause] [Music] $749 the estimates are all over the map but no matter which study you pick the global greenhouse gas emissions produced by the apparel and Footwear industry are absolutely staggering the UN clocks it at about 8% of all the greenhouse gas emissions humans produce and these emissions come from multiple parts of the supply chain like burning fossil fuels for industrial equipment and electricity demand to Power Machinery but one of the big ones is transportation in 1965 the United States made about 95% of our clothing domestically by the '90s it was down to 50% and now we make 2% of our clothing here which means 98% of our clothes are made in other countries and that usually means multiple other countries because clothes are routinely sewn together in one country shipped to another country to be printed shipped to another country to be labeled and tagged shipped to another country to be packaged before being shipped to America and these trips are almost always being made using fossil fuel powered cargo ships trains or planes which and I hope you guessed it emit a whole lot of greenhouse gases and I truly cannot overstate the volume here we are drowning in products from places like shien and timu and whatever new Ultra fast fashion brands realize they can sell disposable clothes to Fashion crazed Americans and I kind of mean drowning literally here because there's an import loophole in the US called the DI Minimus exception that lets you ship a package to the US tarff free if it's less than $800 in value and in 2022 just xien and teu by themselves sent 210 million of these dominous packages which interestingly enough was the population of America when we used to make almost all of our clothes domestically really makes you think or maybe it doesn't we just kind of needed an ending to this section and that number kind of fit nicely so that's how the sausage is made [Music] baby before the year 2000 cotton was the number one ingredient in clothing and it's still a massive Global crop today that's frequently grown in dry areas requiring Farmers to use a huge amount of water for irrigation but don't worry because they're only growing about 70 billion pound of cotton every single year but since 2000 there's a new King in town I'm talking about polyester and it is [\u00a0__\u00a0] everywhere including more than half of all the textiles we use today and here's the thing about polyester it's just plastic which means you right now are probably wearing plastic clothes and where does 99% of all plastic come from you guessed it oil and gas congratulations oil and gas you're not just producing CO2 to ship the clothes you are the clothes and I sure would love to talk about microplastics right now oh boy would I love to say something like between 200,000 and 500,000 tons of microplastics from textiles enter the global marine environment each year or even something like microplastics from your clothes can leech chemicals into your skin and we're basically doing a huge Global experiment to see how plastic tolerant the human body is but this is a buzzfeed list so I guess you want to see which greenhouse gas you are based on who your middle school Crush Was remember the first three bullet points overproduction makes all three of those a lot worse now the figures on how much we overproduce are actually really hard to nail down partially because we produce so many clothes all across the world and it's just really difficult to keep track of them each year we probably make somewhere between 80 and 150 billion articles of clothing and between 10 and 40% is just wasted never sold at all and even if you take the low side of both of those ranges without even considering the clothes people do buy that they probably don't really need you end up with billions of pieces of unnecessary brand new clothing heading right for the landfill or the incinerator or if they're really lucky they'll get to live out the rest of their days in the beautiful atakama desert in Chile in a massive dystopian heap of trash clothes that apparently sometimes Burns releasing all those synthetic fabrics and chemicals back into the sky as toxic smoke but I guess it's all worth it for an unlimited supply of shirts that say [Music] bazinga another one ooh baby we're back again because treating workers poorly and paying them as little as possible has become so normal and so expected that even the premium brands are doing the same [\u00a0__\u00a0] in 2022 investigative journalism group follow the money published a report about sustainability Golden Child Patagonia and it turns out Patagonia manufactures clothes in some of the same factories as fast fashion companies the report claims that one day a factory might be manufacturing for Patagonia but the next day it might be Target or Amazon or Nike or Zara now in 2015 Patagonia made a pledge to pay all their apparel assembly workers a living wage within 10 years years that deadline is next year and what percent of factories that Patagonia uses pay a living wage oh no well okay well who's reporting that cuz there's a lot of fake news out there these days oh no it's their own website and this isn't to say Patagonia and Shen are both equally bad Patagonia is one of the most sustainable large scale apparel brands in the world they're donating money to a bunch of good causes they're facilitating the repurchase and reuse of their clothes through the warn Weare program and it was their own disclosure of their factories that led to the follow the money report they appear to be doing a lot of the right things that's how normalized this has become and if we're really going down this Rabbit Hole a lot of the clothing made in the US is from workers making less than minimum wage there are sweat shops in America the Department of Labor did a series of Sting operations in Los Angeles and found labor violations in 85% of factories including factories used by premium Brands like Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus so while you're almost guaranteed to be getting an environmentally damaging and or human rights abusing shirt if you pay $10 for it you can pay $100 for a shirt that's doing a lot of the same stuff it's enough to make you want to never put on a shirt again so what do you do sorry about that I uh I used to do that a lot that's kind of funny anyway so what do you do well we asked ourselves the same question our first thought was to not make anything new at all we ended up talking to a company that had 100 sun damage shirts to recycle we got them to send those shirts to us instead we printed climate town on them and sold them at live shows not too bad but while repurposing old shirts made sure we didn't add to the climate or labor problems getting a 100 sun damage shirts at random intervals isn't exactly a repeatable process for us or anyone else and it doesn't do a lot to make sure we're supporting the few people who were going out of their way to change the fashion industry so we didn't do [\u00a0__\u00a0] for a few months but then one day we came across a company called ethics merch they run the merch program for the sunrise movement and third act and also a ton of unions across the country and when we asked them if they knew anybody who could make a t-shirt without you know underpaying their workers or beefing the planet too hard they pointed us to a company in North Carolina called TS designs founded by a man named Eric Henry his last name is a first name that's a good start see originally TS designs was a printer for a ton of Major Brands you know your Nikes your tomies your gaps that sort of thing they had a 100 employees who all had good jobs and health care and retirement plans but then after NAFTA and the globalization movement of the 1990s they went from 100 employees to 20 in 2 years and were on the brink of bankruptcy one of the true economic miracles in the whole history of civilization but then Eric decided to shift his company to making sustainable apparel right here in the US and about 15 years ago they started making their cotton of the Carolina's shirts instead of sending every shirt thousands of miles to be put together they use the radical breakthrough technology of getting cotton from a local farmer processing it locally and then making it into shirts and printing on it right there in the same part of the Carolinas it travels less than 800 mil to go from the farm to a full-on finished shirt and if you're having trouble visualizing this here's a nice map I made showing the cotton traveling around Indiana Jones style and this map is not a guess because every company that touches this shirt is trackable and verifiable there's even a QR code in the tag of the shirt that you can scan to see all the companies along the chain who by the way are paying their employees a living wage you want to call the cotton Jenner okay they might not pay up they might be busy but that's their number and also cotton of the Carolina shirts are truly 100% cotton which means they're not messing around with plastic at all not even in the thread also they dry Farm their cotton which means it doesn't require extra irrigation the way we determine if Cotton's ready to pick is if that seed will pop did you hear that pop TS designs has even developed their own printing process which doesn't leave ink on top of the shirts which makes them easier to recycle or if they're in a landfill decompose finally scraps from production go to a company called material return which is a worker-owned Cooperative by the way pretty cool who recycle them into recycled cotton thread what I'm trying to say is that we just really like what companies like TS designs are up to and for the record they did not pay us to say this quite the opposite we paid them thousands of dollars to do a run of climate Town shirts but we also think it's important to shout them out as much as possible cuz it's good to promote things you want to see more of in the world TS designs cotton of the Carolinas QR codes and of course any and of course any good band shirt needs art luckily AI can do that for free and it's actually getting pretty good at remembering that hands usually have five fingers so [\u00a0__\u00a0] you illustrators out that no I'm just kidding we hired a fantastic artist named Margalit Cutler whose work has been in the New Yorker New York Magazine and a bunch of other places not from New York she made us a couple of slick designs and here they are pretty cool huh HH huh okay this that's too many faces and just in case you forgot who made the art there's her signature right there pretty sneaky huh anyway margalit's art gets printed on those cotton of the Carolina shirts which then go to the good Folks at ethics where they drop them in a recycled cardboard shipper from a company called Eco and close and send them right off to you finally completing the Indiana Jones map I hate these guys wow you couldn't make a movie like Indiana Jones anymore what with cancel culture anyway that's the story of how we made climate Town shirts we printed up 423 of each design and we're going to see how it goes proceeds go directly back to making videos like this and also podcasts and newsletters and whatever the hell this is is anyone here a doctor we don't need for real anybody got a master's degree need a little bit of water just a little bit of water a master's degree in a hard in a hard science just a little bit of water a hard science right there get up here is this the perfect process again probably not but I think it's a good way to get the ball rolling in the other direction and if you yourself are thinking about having some custom t-shirts made for your band or your bachelorette party or your pharmaceutical convention I think these are some good things for you to keep in mind on your T-shirt Journey and they may cost a little bit more but that's closer to what a t-shirt should actually cost anyway here's the shirts that we made pretty cool huh back to you Raleigh thanks Raleigh okay let's wrap this thing up there are a lot of climate problems that are so far outside of the hands of individuals that the only thing that can really help is Big policy induced systemic change and while there are a lot of parts of fast fashion that could benefit from policy change in this case consumer demand AKA us buying stuff is also a major factor but bonus it's a factor that you yes you yes you not you too tall but yes you and even you can have some control over you can start by wearing the clothes you already have and if your wardrobe is totally busted like mine is and you want to switch it up a little bit you can do a clothing swap with your friends or Community or buy used clothes secondhand remember a lot of these secondhand clothes have have probably never even been worn I mean it's a pretty thin upside to our over production problem but it's there you can also be more Discerning with your buying Habits by trying to send a clear Market signal by buying from companies that you feel are doing a good job it is super hard to shop with any kind of certainty nowadays because companies know what they're doing as a problem and will often fill their websites with empty promises rather than actual change but there are some links in the description to help you find some responsible manufacturers and also a few minutes on popular search engine google.com can give you a better sense of who you're thinking of buying from it ain't easy okay if it was easy it wouldn't be a huge problem and I wish it was as simple as never buy any clothes ever again but even that falls victim to the divest versus invest problem there's a big push to divest from things like fossil fuels corporate farming and fast fashion and that is a really great push like keep doing that for sure but going the extra mile means reinvesting on the solution side of the problem like investing in renewable energy regenerative agriculture or slow fashion so by all means adjust your personal buying habits but just remember nothing hits quite like policy and lucky for us there's a hot Little Bill coming through the New York state legislature called the fashion act and if it gets passed as is any fashion brand clearing over 100 million in annual revenue would be subject to a Litany of environmental and human rights standards it's honestly a little that the only way to get companies to care about the environment or human rights is to force them to but them's the breaks our friends over at climate change makers have put together a whole Playbook on ways you can get involved with your state legislature and you can check it out Link in the description and once more with feeling this time we made climate Town shirts I'm so happy about them they came out really great buying them will not save the planet but it was an incredibly eye-opening experience trying to go through the process of making shirts with any amount of sustainability in mind and if you'd like to commemorate that process by buying yourself a t-shirt I think that would be a very cool idea you just had there's a link right below the YouTube video should be right below the YouTube video I'm not a 100% sure that we will have figured that out by the time you're watching this so if it's not there check in the description if it is there you can use that link if you feel like it okay big thanks to Eric Henry and TS designs for making shirts that we actually feel good about bringing into this world and also thanks again to ethics merch and folks like Daniel and Ruth who guided us through this process and are running the store for us they're working on connecting ethical and sustainable apparel companies with people who want to buy ethical and sustainable [\u00a0__\u00a0] and they've done exactly that thing for us and also huge thank you to margarite Cutler for doing the art and forever immortalizing this mustache on a t-shirt if I'm being completely honest it kind of freaks me out but the real question is do we still have a patreon page hell yes we do and we actually added a whole bunch of new tiar and perks and cut footage and town halls and all kinds of [\u00a0__\u00a0] that makes it actually kind of good so check it out Link in the bio also if we get to 5,000 paid patrons by June 1st I will install a telephone right here on my desk that you can call if you're a patron wow doesn't that sound like an incredible waste of time for both both of us probably you'll have to find out also also we have a podcast called the climate deniers Playbook that features me and Daily Show writer slm my childhood friend Nicole Conlin also also also we have a newsletter written by me and climate Town writer director Matt Nelson links to all that in the description and that's it thanks so much for watching really appreciate you see you next time okay I'm hungry I have not not tried marijuana uh I have never used it at any [Music] [Applause] time did you hear that goodbye"

    "transcript": "ah electricity lightning in a bottle the devil's juice Thor piss now I had it with the de the devil's juice I almost never think about it when it's working but when my electricity goes out for even a minute it is a Hindenburg level tragedy now 15 years ago a lot of the power to make this electricity would have come from coal dirty polluting frankly rude coal and that would have made me sick but nowadays I don't have to be sick or even feel bad about it at all because there's a new number one electricity producer in America I'm talking about natural gas and even better everybody loves it not just those Brave Patriots who refuse to cook on anything else they decided gas powered stoves racist and have to go I have actually taped myself to my stove I've been here for 24 hours now GOP thrusts Gast stoves Biden's green agenda into the culture wars oh not the culture wars probably true see conservatives love how natural gas comes from our own domestic sources and hello bipartisanship all those Godless Kami Liberals are also on team natural gas because it led to this incredible decrease in our carbon dioxide emissions and if you're just looking at this graph you might be tempted to think switching from coal to natural gas was great for the climate but unfortunately the house of natural gas was built on the found Foundation of ignoring one critical aspect gas has a tendency to leak and you might find yourself asking so what you know so some of the gas doesn't make it to the power plant who cares but the thing about natural gas is that it's mostly made up of methane that's the part that explodes so nice oh yeah and we probably shouldn't even call it Natural Gas G because the word natural implies that it's maybe good or clean burning or something when really it's almost entirely methane which is a greenhouse gas meaning when it gets in the atmosphere it absorbs the heat that was escaping into space and sends it right back down to warm up the planet just like CO2 except it's actually not just like CO2 because methane can trap 80 times more heat than carbon dioxide in a 20-year period it's like when LeBron James is playing high school basketball he's 6'8 and they are 95 lb soaking wet uh-oh is it true so yeah when you're just comparing coal and natural gas AKA methane at the power plant gas generates a little less than half the CO2 that coal does but when you take into account the many many methane leaks at the well heads in the processing plants and the compressor stations and the 3 million miles of pipelines natural gas's climate imp impacts in the US are right back in Coal territory baby and we don't even know the full extent of the damage gas has caused because leaks are really hard to detect and the primary method the US government used to account for leaks was to ask the oil and gas companies how much methane they were leaking and then take their word for it awesome and every year we're getting more invested in natural gas it's now 40% of our power generation in the US making it the number one source of our electricity and we also pipe gas to factories and houses and Office Buildings and a ton of other places for them to burn themselves and despite burning about 88 billion cubic feet of natural gas every single day we are producing so much of it that we're also super cooling it down into liquefied natural gas loading it up on ships and then sending it away to other countries all across the world a process I will note that requires a ton of extra energy and emits even more methane making it worse for the climate than coal in a lot of scenarios and it's not just like a little bit of LNG in 8 years we went from basically not exporting it at all to being the world's number one LNG exporter and I know America loves exporting our culture but normally it's pretty innocuous like trying to get French people to try our blonde guys nachos but in this case exporting our obsession with natural gas has the potential to lock the entire Globe into using yet another dangerous polluting fossil fuel for decades to come but maybe there's something we can do about it maybe and for once there's actually some good news about natural gas at the end of this video so you'll just have to wait 40 minutes how is this video 40 minutes I have to edit the what am I doing well let's get to it hi I'm Raley William a guy with a climate science and policy degree and about two more good years left in me and this is a video about the natural gas industry scamming America welcome to climate [Music] town the year was 2009 and a fresh-faced Barack Hussein Obama had just won the presidential election by refusing to show the future president his birth certificate Bazinga but as soon as Obama got the keys to the White House car he found himself driving directly into the oncoming traffic of a recession a ton of unemployment and a climate change inducing amount of coal power now Obama didn't love Coal Power but American presidents have typically had one priority that's over everything else energy security we're here to talk about America's energy security an issue that's been a priority for my Administration since the day I took office energy security energy security security of our energy in 2009 Cole was King and everyone from the coal companies themselves to the Energy Information Administration were going long on that Kentucky Rock STI environmentalists climate Advocates and a whole bunch of other people hated it but coal was cheap plentiful and it ran the [\u00a0__\u00a0] country for the past Century don't you go near my coal but then Cole had one of those moments where it coughed and its friends were like Cole are you okay and there were minor chords playing and it said yeah I'm good but Cole was not good because the new technology had loaded up its sleigh with jobs and energy security and climate action for all the boys and girls that's right I'm talking about fracking [Music] and also directional drilling now come on you've heard of fracking it sounds like the kind of thing a Sci-Fi character would say as a swear word but it was actually one of the most important developments in all of American History seriously right up there with the moon landing or the invention of the high five now historically American oil and gas production has been a real roller coaster there was a time when you could be out burying your dog and enough oil and gas would pop out of the ground for you to buy a th000 dogs but by the early 2000s conventional oil production in the US was way down and natural gas was hanging on by a threat and since America still loved fossil fuels that meant we were going to have to get them from foreign governments in Geneva yesterday OPEC slapped another large increase on crude oil prices gasoline shortages are spreading across the country say all out of gas no man you supposed to to at 8:00 it's A4 to 9: what are you doing in line and we draw the line at other countes trying to push us around pushing other countries around is our thing we own it we invented it you can't have it you know what you can't have blam one of those how about a second one and I bet you never seen one of these before okay uh fracking is short for hydraulic fracturing which means using water and other fluids to literally fract the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of that rock freeing the trapped hydrocarbons and sucking them into the fluid now fracking itself was not a new technology but because they could only drill in Fairly straight lines you can only SEAL Team Six smaller sections of the rock before you got through the Shale layer that held most of the oil and gas fracking and horizontal drilling came together in the 2000s to unlock a ton of oil and gas that was previously thought to be too expensive to extract and while fracking doesn't sound like the kind of thing environmentalists would think is very cool and it would almost certainly make enemies out of a bunch of people who could suddenly light their drinking water on fire fra natural gas had a climate angle that gas companies were very good at using it would be a bridge fuel Bridge fuel Bridge fuel Bridge fuel is nothing more than a bridge guys we know natural gas is a fossil fuel and it's extractive and it's not great for the environment and we hate that about it we really do we hate that but all that fracked gas could replace that stinky old coal while you guys are getting Renewables to work or whatever we love solar we love all that renewable crap let's go windmills am I right so how about partnering with big daddy natural gas and then when you guys get your little windmills to work we'll totally leave we promise I must have missed 60 Minutes what are you saying so natural gas fever blew through American politicians like a tornado in an Ikea environmental groups aren't so easily fooled but since America's coal addiction seemed like our biggest problem progressives were willing to temporarily Embrace natural gas as a bridge fuel to replace coal and an Unholy Alliance was formed between natural gas and environmental Advocates like the water keeper Alliance the American Lung Association and the Sierra Club the concept that we were trying to convey was to say eventually we have to be off all fossil fuel fuels but we have to get off coal first oil second and gas third and Obama is making speeches like this it's the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change we it turns out are the Saudi Arabia of natural gas it could support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade in a cleaner and cheaper way and having a nearly Limitless supply of fracked natural gas right beneath our feet it seemed too good to be true it was too good to be true obviously it was you're very perceptive I watch 60 minutes so if you remember the intro yes methane gas really does emit less CO2 than coal for electricity generation but that doesn't take into account a fun little thing called fugitive emissions see when coal falls out of a coal car it just becomes an adorable little rock but when methane leaks out of a pipe it becomes an invisible gas with a seemingly insatiable desire to grab on to heat and return it to the planet and that wouldn't really be a problem if methane didn't leak every godamn all the time here's a former Exxon engineer from a truly wonderful Frontline doc series about oil and gas when they were marketing natural gas as clean energy they didn't really know what they were talking about because they were fixated on the idea that natural gas when burned produces half the carbon dioxide emissions of coal the industry was not monitoring methane leakage so they did not have data about how much was leaking and there wasn't much appetite for management to measure methane leakage because if they found out there was a problem they would have to do something about it the increase in global temperature for methane is staggering scientists estimate that methane is responsible for 20 to 30% of the modern climate warming despite there being 200 times less methane than C2 in the atmosphere terrifying and more on that feeling after this who what is this a ad no not a ad well yes a ad but not a ad for like Patriot powder for your underground bunker this is unad for the climate Town patreon page yes here at climate town we spend weeks researching topics calling experts and watching hours of footage from the 1980s before we even write a single word of a script cing with gasing with gas and the only reason we can take that kind a time is because of our supporters on patreon and starting right now I'm sweetening the deal with a whole bunch of extra patreon perks that are actually a little bit good yeah I'm talking a patreon only Discord Channel even more behind the scenes exclusives bloopers live Q&A sessions with the climate town team after episode releases and more maybe you're thinking I like the videos but how do I know they use my money responsibly let me tell you here at clim Town we're frugal see these whiteboards free on Craigslist just cuz the edges were a little [\u00a0__\u00a0] up see this couch it's uncomfortable and I hate the way it looks but I love the way my sister's co-worker sold it to me for $40 see all these bags of coffee they were expired so we got them for free this is hundreds of dollars worth of coffee this is a drug bust worth of coffee what I'm trying to say is that here at climate town we use money responsibly and that is an official climate Town promise okay well I can explain that obviously we got it for free on credit card points on account of howed up my face looks so if you like what we're doing and you want to support us you might want to check out our patreon page and if you're already on there you don't have to do anything extra but I encourage you to check out the new tiers and offerings and just to wet your Collective whistles you dry little whistlers we're doing an incentive thing here if we get to 5,000 patrons we're currently at like 3700 we get to 5,000 by June 1st I will install a telephone right here and I'll answer that phone I will answer anyone who calls it and it's going to be like an old school phone like the kind Al paccino has in the movie Heat okay we'll give you the number you call it and then it rings the phone which I will then diligently answer at the very least for the full first day if it starts to affect my ability to edit and get these videos done maybe we'll move to like a monthly call-in thing I'm not sure the climate Town patreon will'll use that money real good wow what a ad anyway methane can get into the atmosphere from a bunch of different sources landfills animal agriculture even wildfires release methane but the oil and gas industry is responsible for more than a quarter of all the methane that Americans put into the atmosphere and that's just wasted methane it's not heating any houses is not making any electricity it's just needlessly escaping the oil and gas system where it will do nothing but contribute to global warming for years to come and remember that's just the methane the oil and gas industry has reported missing there's a whole bunch more leaked methane that goes unreported and we have no idea how much it is because it's really hard to track first of all natural gas is odorless and colorless which means if it's leaking but you're not looking at it you're probably not going to notice anything that special stink smell is added before they sell gas to Consumers so you can tell when your gas is leaking because one time in the 1930s an entire School exploded and they figured stinking it up a bit might help keep casualties down when it's leaking out of a well head or a processing plant and you're not actively looking at it through an $80,000 methane vision camera you're probably not going to see or smell anything and speaking of not actively looking for it the epa's traditional method of monitoring for gas Leakes really was to ask the oil and gas companies that's it the millions of miles of gas pipelines and infrastructure were to be self-monitored and self-reported and since there are fines for releasing methane they could either tell on themselves and pay the fine or let the invisible plume of gas that no one knows about just blow away and keep their money and God damn I have heard of some huge conflicts of interest but this one has got to be top 10 [Music] it's now you might be thinking this sounds a lot like conjecture do you have some kind of specific example you can use right here to stick the landing on this bit yes in August of 2023 a valve at a Philips 66 facility in Texas failed and leaked 9.5 million cubic feet of natural gas directly into the atmosphere and since I had no fing clue how much 9.5 million cubic feet meant that's 300,000 lb of a gas poured directly into the sky and no one reported it but then several months later a nonprofit called carbon mapper was looking at some satellite data that just happened to be recording Over Texas at that time and discovered the enormous unreported methane leak over the Philips 66 facility Bloomberg green asked Philip 66 for comment in November and wouldn't you know it but 6 days later Philip 66 reported the methane leak to Texas State regulators and this is just my own personal speculation but it really seems like if that satellite hadn't been watching that exact area and carbon mapper hadn't been crunching the numbers that methane leak would have gone unreported and I will go on to speculate that this is not the first time fossil fuel companies have covered up their methane leaks I guess what I'm trying to say is that there is a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton of methane leaking out of the oil and gas industry one study estimates that just us natural gas pipelines buy themselves leak between 1.2 and 2.6 million tons of methane every year this has the climate impact of adding between 25 million and 50 million additional cars to the roads in just wasted fugitive emissions so if you're the kind of person who wants to do a cost benefit analysis here you'll find you can afford to lose about 3 to 5% of the methane through leaking before natural gas is worse for the climate than the coal it was supposed to be replacing the US government used to think we were leaking about 1.4% which is already not great but after some more in-depth studies the White House acknowledges it's more like 2.3% or higher and it seems like the more we look at fugitive methane emissions the more we realize we've been underestimating them for decades by a lot and that's not to say that coal is secretly good it's not it's bad they're both bad options it's like we spent billions of dollars to replace a heroin addiction with an opioid epidemic which to America's Credit is extremely on brand and I know I've been talking about gas leaks and methane emissions for a while and this is all stuff that's apparent to us now but it's important to look at this in context back in the 2010s when we were going Hog Wild on natural gas it was much less obvious how the next 10 to 20 years might go they were scared shitless that coal use would continue to pump CO2 into the atmosphere and they were just so Ding Dang excited that this new American Natural Gas could burn cleaner and it wasn't just The Vibes natural gas had those three letters that you always want on your side I'm talking of course about MIT that's right in 2011 the massive Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy initiative released a massive study called the future of natural gas it was written by about 20 MIT dorks with the support of a stacked advisory committee and you don't have to read all 308 pages to get to their very official take it's right there in the forward and acknowledgements the US has a ton of gas and it could be a bridge fuel to a lowc carbon future in short let's [Music] Frack well I guess that's that case closed I mean it's MIT after all yeah you know what let's just take a quick look at the sponsors just in case something comes up first and foremost we thank the American clean Skies Foundation discussions with the foundation led to the conclusion that an integrative study on the future of natural gas in a carbon constrained world could contribute to the energy debate in an important way and the foundation stepped forward as the major sponsor uh awesome the American clean Skies Foundation yes guys damn when I wake up in the morning and I look out the window and the sky is clean I am sure there's nothing to look into here but see as I'm already [Music] here thank you Mr chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to discuss the great promise of natural gas in the United States Aubrey mcclinon CEO of chese energy and and also chairman of the American clean Skies foundation and also chairman of the American clean Skies Foundation curious a fracking company a big fracking guy it's fracking money huh yeah that's right the American clean Skies Foundation was formed and funded by the CEO of Chesapeake Energy one of the Premier fracking companies in America so it might not come as a huge shock that the abstract of the paper praises the abundance lowcost and CO2 emission reduction capabilities of natural gas while noting that the Environmental fin impacts are challenging but manageable we have to roll all the way down to page 171 after the end of the main report to appendix 1A to find a more in-depth discussion of fugitive emissions and even in that appendix it mostly adds up to we don't know enough to talk about it and if the leaks are bad I'm sure they'll get better in the future but maybe one of the authors of the paper Ernest mon would care to comment roll it front line monise would not talk about it in our interview other than to say it was transparent it the point is we always believe in transparency and and so that's yeah so yeah the 2010s turned out to be a sort of jumbalaya of people willing to downplay the problems with natural gas for various reasons and by 2012 natural gas had the full support of the tosos presents the president of the United States the development of natural gas we'll create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy and by the way it was public research dollars over the course of 30 years that helped develop the Technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale R reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground and after thato it was on hot diggity dog America there's a new kid in town and his name is Johnny natural gas that's right gas production is booming like a flamethrower at a popcorn convention Obama says jump natural gas says you got it Daddy O and who's that at the door why it's the new Secretary of Energy Ernest monise and no not a different Ernest monise the same Ernest mon as before the guy who wrote the Mit paper about the glories of natural gas Blast Off more natural gas and while we're at it have a cigarette and relax about all those gas leaks because in 2013 the EPA lowered their estimates for how much methan in the oil and gas industry was leaking by 20% why did the EPA do that because the oil and gas industry pinky swore it was true did the EPA do their own testing to verify no they did not and ring a dingding what's this for the first time in American history natural gas beats out coal is the number one power source in the USFA what an upset seriously and not to blabber this point but in 2009 America's most informed energy agency the EI predicted coal would be our number one power source for decades to come the foreseeable future and then 6 years later natural gas came through and made him look like a bunch of Charlie Horses so it's kind of an important point to remember then it seemed like Obama was starting to take methane a little more seriously with a clean power plan and some methane leak restrictions but oh no here comes Trump and boom there go the clean power plan boom there go those methane leak restrictions boom Trump tries to bring back coal but bang natural gas Cuts him off with the the past my God gas is King now can anybody beat natural gas nope he couldn't do it natural gas continues to dominate modern American electricity generation we're fracking a record high amount of gas new pipelines were approved despite environmental opposition but not so fast Jackson the Biden Administration is making some major climate moves including the biggest piece of climate legislation in US history lower energy cost for millions of families I'm going to take the most aggressive action ever ever ever to confront the climate crisis but natural gas is still not going down that's enough of that I don't know what year it is for you but for me it's 2024 and the natural gas industry is only expanding every calendar year they're spending billions on new gas infrastructure to accommodate the ever increasing amount of fracked gas unfortunately all that Supply means American Gas producers have to slow down their fracking operation come on I'm just kidding they're going to get our friends addicted to natural gas too that's right I'm talking about the black tar heroin of methane liquefied natural [Music] gas basically fossil fuel companies are fracking and extracting natural gas here in America loading it onto big special boats and sending it to places like the EU the UK Japan South Korea and India and if you're picking up on the pattern of this episode yes lngg is significantly more damaging to the climate than regular natural gas for a couple of obvious reasons for one the only way to make any money shipping natural gas around the world in a big big boat is to cram it in there real tight and that means turning that gas into a liquid but the only way to do that is to Mr Freeze it down until it gets so cold it doesn't want to be a gas anymore which doesn't happen until you get to - 260\u00b0 F which means right off the bat you have to waste about 8% of all the natural gas just to power the liquefaction process and that's not even considering the export terminals tendency to get a little leaky and then there are the LNG tankers which burn a ton of fuel to move that LNG all over the world that fuel is either one of the most polluting fuel sources we have known as heavy fuel oil or bunker fuel or just the natural gas itself now the trips are thousands of miles long which allow leak prone LNG ships plenty of opportunity to seep methane out into the atmosphere as they're tra tring to their destination woo all that's left now is to turn that liquid gas back into a gas gas which requires even more gas for power oh and these are specialized single-purpose funky ass gas tankers which means they have to make the thousands of miles long return Journey empty well not quite empty they have to keep some of that LNG on board so the tanker doesn't break down on the way back and all of these LG related emissions happen before the gas gets used for its intended purpose where it will release more emissions a recent paper from 2023 found that the greenhouse gas emissions associated with LNG can be quite a bit higher than coal depending on the type of fuel the ship uses and the length of the trip and remember the United States is not a side character in The LNG world before 2016 we exported exactly zero LNG from the lower 48 states but in the 8 years since we became the number one exporter on the planet the absolute Bonanza of LNG began with a tiny little press release from the eia about Louisiana shipping its first cargo of domestically sourced natural gas out of the Sabine Pass export terminal they had gotten all their permits they had built their facility and on February 24th 2016 they wave goodbye to their little boat full of hopes and dreams and LNG Bound for Brazil oh and also there were four other massive LNG export terminals being bolted together at warp speed at the exact same time soon all five were online and another three have come online since for a total of eight operational export terminals each one costing billions to tens of billions of dollars to construct and capable of exporting between 200 million and 4.55 billion cubic feet of gas per day that's about 10% of the natural gas we produce in America going overseas every single day and of course on a local level all that new LNG infrastructure produces some nasty air pollution and a ton of other issues for the people who happen to be living in the places that private companies wanted to set up their export Terminals and they're being built in high income areas with predominantly white residents sorry wait a minute [\u00a0__\u00a0] and being the world's number one exporter of L G might be enough for lesser countries but here in the United States it's not even close here's the LNG capacity we currently have and here's the LNG capacity that's currently under construction that's right we are set to more than double the amount of LNG we can export to other countries and remember this is permanent infrastructure being built by companies who expect to get Decades of use out of it and if you think we're stopping here you must be out of your godam mind because here's the LG capacity the United States government has already issued permits for we are world champions right now but just you wa till we're at triple capacity and since these projects regularly lock in long-term contracts for their natural gas it's going to be pretty tough to decrease Global gas demand 20% by 2030 and 75% by 20150 you know the numbers the International Energy agency has made it very clear we need to to hit to get to Net Zero by 2050 in order to avoid catastrophic climate change catastrophic what a word great word a lot of good C's and T's in there catastrophic good A's too good a sound and it is at this time that I ask you in what way is a constant and massive expansion of entrenched natural gas infrastructure planned over decades treating it like a bridge fuel a bridge fuel Bridge fuel we need an energy source that will serve as a bridge like first gen's natural gas natural gas when I think of a bridge I think of a path between point a and point B what I'm seeing here is an amazing effort to turn point a into an unsalable Fortress of natural gas that has no intention of winding itself down in favor of renewable energy increasing exports kind of seems like a way of further entrenching natural gas demand across the globe and of course it does in what world is the natural gas industry going to willingly put itself out of business it's crazy it's like making a deal with the devil and then being shocked to find yourself getting absolutely by the devil it's the devil that's his whole thing it's the devil Kramer the devil now you remember that hole here's our LM capacity now but here's the capacity we have under construction and here's the capacity that's been permitted and ready to break ground well there's a fourth one it's the LG capacity we'll have if all the proposed projects get permitted and built and my friend it is a real bear this would represent an LNG capacity that is almost five times greater than our current world number one capacity but I'm using the subjunctive tense here because the the Biden Administration recently paused permitting for new LNG infrastructure to look at drum roll please the climate implications of LNG infrastructure that's right if you remember hearing a lot about LNG in the news recently it might have been something like this it's the administration trying to say that storms are bad so we're going to ban these exports freezing the export of liquefied natural gas or maybe it was more like this this is all designed in the end the whole climate Hysteria to to enable China to become the global dominant now these are fun but not uh what's that thing accurate see basically there's an LNG export terminal in Louisiana called kushu pass it currently exists and It produced its first LNG in January of 2022 now they really wanted to expand with a second kushu pass terminal or cp2 but a whole bunch of climate activists made a big old racket about it within 10 years American exported LNG will be producing more greenhouse gases than everything that happens on the continent of Europe and it actually worked not only did the Biden Administration pause the permitting for cp2 but they stopped issuing any new LNG permits so they could assess things like the perilous impacts of methane on our planet and this is not a minor change in the way we permit LNG before this the department of energy had never denied an NG permit for a project that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had already signed off on it's not every day that a presidential Administration takes a meaningful swing at the oil and gas industry in fact it happens on almost no days ever it's like the Cubs win the World Series kind of rare natural gas has gotten an incredible amount of special treatment since it exploded onto the scene and this decision could be signaling a change in the way we view methane now I don't want to get out over my skis here this decision only affects this portion of LNG in America and there's still a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ton of climate work to be done but this my friends is an official win in my book and oh my God we finally made it to the what we're going to do about it phase of the video congratulations people out there first absolutely foremost we got to avoid the coal versus natural gas trap we can't compare the two worst options and then pick between those two options we don't want want to do either of them it's like asking if you want to drink diet piss or piss zero the answer is water please and in this case that means uh Renewables like solar wind Hydro probably some nuclear and energy storage to balance the grid second and this is a quick one remember that natural gas is basically just methane there's a ton of studies that show that when people hear natural gas they think it's good but when people hear methane they think it's bad despite the fact that it's basically the same thing so remember that third judging by all the natural gas infrastructure we keep on building methane gas is going to be around for a while and that means it's going to keep leaking so we need to continue to fight for tighter methane leak standards how do we do that great question our friends over at climate change makers have put together a Playbook on ways you can get involved in methane leak advocacy check it out right now leak in the bio and double bonus it's about to get a lot easier to track leaks thanks to the incredible work of two climate groups who are sending fullon satellites up into the night sky to detect methane leaks from space big shout out to carbon mapper and the environmental defense fund with their new satellite data and all the other Leak Detection improvements we might finally get a more complete picture of just how much methane is leaking into the atmosphere and I just got to imagine that real leak monitoring is going to be a better system than calling up fossil fuel companies and asking them what up what up what up what up that was comedy 20 years ago all right if you take away anything from this episode just remember to get more educated about the climate crisis we got a bunch of resources in the description we got some videos we got articles and books even books they're still there remember books books computers for going to [Music] sleep wow we did it all of us did it you and me equal effort on all sides we made it thank you so much for watching and thank you to climate power and Canary media for partnering with us on this episode the world of methane gas is a dark and scary one but their support research and Reporting were incredibly helpful on making this video and don't forget to check out our new and improved patreon page God damn you really got to check out all the new perks we're offering and there are even more just go check it out you curious little fox and I'm not kidding about that phone thing I'll install that son of a b right here if we get to 5,000 patrons by June 1st that's a Scout's Honor promise the biggest promise a scout can make and yes I Was A Boy Scout and guess what else we got we got a newsletter baby that's right me and writer director Matt Nelson write about all the stuff we couldn't cram into the less than 10 videos we make every year it's a lot of fun it's good climate info it's the same writing team as the climate Town episodes and if you sign up it'll show up right in your inbox that's a guarantee we've also also got a podcast called the climate deniers Playbook and I host it with my childhood friend and Daily Show writer Nicole conin basically we sit at a big table with our producer Ben bolt and we break down climate disinformation campaigns and honestly it's a lot of fun we just started releasing episodes of our new season so if you haven't listened before you picked a great time to start friend and that's it we did it and just remember there is a secret Easter egg hunt embedded throughout all these videos and literally no one has found it yet am I joking who knows I'm not okay okay I have not tried marijuana uh I have never used it at any [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] time sh"

    "transcript": "\"When I first moved to Berlin, I was most excited about this!\" Cheap, sustainable and full of history. But the hoarding is showing up in my store room five years later. How have I\u00a0ended up with a low-grade foot massager? And it's been three years since\u00a0this mixer stopped working. We have so much stuff in Europe \u2013 and create more e-waste per capita than any other region on earth. \"One problem is, when this stuff breaks, I have no idea what to do about it.\" \"But places like Berlin want to get one step ahead.\" As part of its sustainability initiatives, Berlin is working\u00a0to fix a big gap in the circular economy. \"I'm convinced the markets will\u00a0go for the repairable products.\" Berlin will give up to 200\u00a0euros per year to people who repair their own broken household items. And the EU hopes that such schemes will drastically reduce the waste produced here. \"And we also need the infrastructure to do that \u2013 like this massive\u00a0refurbishment factory is trying to do.\" \"The big question is though: Do schemes\u00a0like this just leave us feeling good or do they actually do something to tackle so much waste?\"  I dove into the DW archives for a visual history of Berlin and its wondrous second-hand markets. Post WWII-Berlin has always had a \"make-do\" approach. West Berlin was cut off by the\u00a0Wall and materials in the East were scarce. So many things were by default what\u00a0we now call pre-owned or pre-loved. This second-hand mindset has more recently reared its head as resistance against blatant consumerism that has taken over large parts of the West. Berlin has around 40 weekly flea markets; repair shops will teach you how to\u00a0fix your bike; and some streets are strewn with tailors for old clothes. These are particularly appealing to me, because I come from a country where waste is\u00a0still relatively low and repair culture is thriving \u2013 I made another video about it. \"Nowadays it's getting more and more  complicated to get things done.\" That's Ren\u00e9 Repasi, a member Germany's Social Democratic Party, who is working to\u00a0push through policy change. He's talking about how the complexity of gadgets has\u00a0gone up. Remember when you could just take the battery out of your old phone and replace it? We also now mix resources more \u2013 with electronics now in our shoes for example. And we need so much\u00a0more raw material for our growing energy needs. Ren\u00e9 breaks down how the EU is pushing back. \"Hardware: there are certain coffee machine producers where you need a special key to open\u00a0it in order to repair and this key is either not available or expensive \u2013 not allowed anymore. Contractual: if you go with your phone to somebody else to repair it, you lose your contractual\u00a0guarantee \u2013 not allowed anymore. And the last thing that we introduced is we request from the\u00a0member states to introduce support measures.\" So Austria, France and a couple of states\u00a0in Germany have now introduced a \"repair bonus\" \u2013 where you can get part of the repair\u00a0paid for. A research group calculated savings from the scheme in the state of Th\u00fcringen from 2021 to 2023 and found that the more than 30,000 subsidized repairs avoided almost\u00a0400 tons of electronic waste and almost 3,000 tons of CO2 equivalent. More than a third of\u00a0users said they would have not repaired their product if not for this cashback scheme. So many\u00a0regions, including Berlin, are giving it a go too. The state here will now subsidize 50% of\u00a0the repair cost for a long list of household items when you send your bills in. And\u00a0this is capped at 200 euros per year. This is all part of a new directive that the\u00a0EU approved this year that each member-state will write into law by 2026. It obliges\u00a0companies to increase the minimum warranty period and lower the cost of spare parts. \"We have these examples that a part of a dishwasher, for example \u2013 simple plastic part in a\u00a0dishwasher \u2013 if you use 3D printing it would cost you \u20ac0.50, if you purchase it from the producer, you have to pay \u20ac200. Nobody can explain this, this is ridiculous. Therefore we included a rule, that prices have to be reasonable; that consumers can request the check of the prices from judges. Then you can think of repair cafes, where the municipality offers free repair caf\u00e9s that people\u00a0can get help in order to get the products being repaired. So to prompt the entire repair. And by\u00a0that we get a whole boost for the repair sector.\" Let's check it out \u2013 Berlin lists its registered\u00a0repair caf\u00e9s online. I'm heading to one that's set up inside a second-hand mall run by\u00a0the city's waste management authority. The authority collects waste and preserves special\u00a0things that they think deserve a longer life. \"This is actually how I drink beer \u2013 no actually like this!\" And people donate things too. \"That's so cheap!\" \"Hello!\" \"No, I can't do it!\" The repairer didn't want to be filmed because in\u00a0true Berlin style his anarchist group believes in the messaging over the individual. \"I\u2019ve brought my old mixer grinder that is broken. I would like to repair it.\" \"So this main part down here should, in my opinion, definitely not to be used\u00a0anymore. We have to get this rubber part again, even if we were to work a 3D printer, we wouldn't get the stability we need.\" \"Ok, yeah.\" \"I'll help you learn how to repair. That\u00a0is my wish, that is my very central wish.\" \"Why is that so important to you?\" \"We really need to work to get people to think about repair and sustainability. So the principle\u00a0that we only have one earth and only limited raw materials and that's it. We may not be able to\u00a0influence the big players, the tech industry or anything like that. But we can make sure that our\u00a0children become resilient to certain advertising, become resilient to certain principles and then ensure that things run sensibly.\" I can\u2019t apply for the repair bonus yet, but when\u00a0I come back with my new part next month, I will. I wonder though, what happens in places where\u00a0people lack access to places or schemes like this? Does repair always make sense? One study compared the price of buying new versus repairing washing machines and vacuum\u00a0cleaners. For such expensive products it found that in every instance it was significantly\u00a0cheaper to repair over replace until the very end of life, at which point the two switch. A group of European universities found that overall, while recycling has stolen the glory, repair is the most important pillar of the circular economy. You could save several\u00a0times the energy required by repairing a household item rather than recycling it \u2013 which would include breaking down the device, separating its parts, changing their form, and\u00a0sending each back into a stream of circulation. So repair infrastructure really needs to catch\u00a0up. And to do that at scale, we need big players. We\u2019ve driven across the border to Poland, to\u00a0visit one of the biggest factories in Europe that buys and refurbishes old things. ReBuy\u00a0says they currently receive 1,500 packages a week through the post: electronics, books, iPads, game consoles and watches. \"Look at that!\" Here they check them for quality and sell them back for a longer\u00a0warranty period than the original \u2013 as part of their policy to make things last longer. Its CEO Philip Gattner says their customer base is growing as interest in a\u00a0circular economy has picked up. \"The first aspect is of course simply expanding\u00a0the lifetime of products by making it easy for people who don't need their used product\u00a0anymore, to give them a second life. Trading it in and then giving a second consumer the\u00a0chance to use it for another 2-3 years. The really convincing argument about our business\u00a0model is that price savings on the one hand and sustainability are not contradicting each other.\" Without the price being low, Gattner believes that the model won't work \u2013 which aligns with Berlin's repair bonus idea \u2013 which he sees as the next big market. \"Over the past years, we also expanded into the area of repair. So we have our own repair facility where we do display changes, battery changes and other repairs. And that obviously  has an additional\u00a0impact on saving e-waste. And that's an additional area where we see quite some potential.\" \"Here we have Huaweii, here some batteries..\" \"And do you ever mix and match the parts and make your own phone just for fun?\" \"We could do it, yes, but we never\u00a0did it. We have enough work to do.\" It's still picking up, and currently only\u00a0very few phones get repaired in Europe every day. So I want to put this in perspective. Because while everything I've seen is inspiring in one direction, I'm still bombarded with ads like\u00a0this. And at these prices and the convenience \u2013 can this more sustainable option even compete? The latest UN report on e-waste is bleak. It says e-waste is growing five times faster than\u00a0the amount of electronics collected or sent for recycling. Which is bad news for the environment, and the billions of dollars' worth of valuable resources that could be recovered and re-used. So we are going to see a lot more of this \u2013 until economic incentives like the one Berlin, which\u00a0have proved to work in some member states, really do tip over a large enough part of the\u00a0population. And when industry truly catches up. \"I\u2019ve had to borrow a friend's blender until\u00a0my new part comes. But I will follow up in the comments. And don\u2019t forget to tell\u00a0us your thoughts too \u2013 what do you think of schemes like this? Oh, and come back\u00a0every Friday for more videos. Cheers!\""

Not because the technology is trash, but because solar panels are built to last between 20 to 30 years.\" Soon we could be looking at 27 million\u00a0tons of out-of-date solar waste. And only a tiny fraction gets recycled. Around\u00a080% of old panels are landfilled! \"Big problem.\" One: plastics end up in the environment. Two: precious metals would just go to waste. And three: recycling saves emissions. So I\u2019m here in the French Alps to find a fix. \"And what this has to do with baking and bathing: now.\" We\u2019re at the French company ROSI. Founded\u00a0in 2017, they\u2019re one of the pioneers in solar recycling. This is Antoine Chalaux, he has been working here for the past four years. \"What are the main process steps in your recycling process?\" \"So, the first step is to get rid of the\u00a0polymers. So, we do it with a thermal treatment. It's a pyrolysis process in a furnace that\u00a0eliminates the polymers. And then we separate the material with mechanical sortation. And then\u00a0you are at the last step because the photovoltaic cells contain different metals. And these metals we want to separate them from each other. So, we have a chemical treatment. A small light\u00a0chemical treatment that we do that detaches the silicon from the silver. And this\u00a0way at the end we recover all the materials inside the PV panels.\"  Basically, a solar panel is made of a few main\u00a0ingredients that need to be separated during the recycling process. You\u2019ve got tempered glass, thermoplastic glue, the cells with silicon, silver and copper, a plastic back sheet and an aluminum frame that holds everything together. Of course, the precise mix\u00a0of components varies by manufacturer. \"Why is it so hard to recycle these panels?\" \"So, the good thing with solar panels is that they are made to last very long. 20, 30 years outside\u00a0in any weather conditions they can last, because of the construction. This construction, with a\u00a0strong glass sheet in the front with polymers gluing everything together, it's very water-resistant. The problem is: now we need to recycle them. And we need to separate all these\u00a0materials to put them back in the economy. And they are all glued together with polymer. So,\u00a0the most challenging first step is to separate the materials from the polymers. This is\u00a0not possible if you crush it, because if you crush it you create small particles all\u00a0glued together with this polymer.\" And the plastic is literally everywhere. \"So, even when you now remove this. You still can't access the cells, right?\" \"Exactly. You have different types of polymers, different layers.\" \"So, there's even more. Oh. Wow.\" \"This is difficult, ah?\" \"Yeah.\" So, the first step is to get rid of the plastics. The panels get put into this big grey furnace. And because ROSI is still in the patenting\u00a0process, everything today is pretty much top secret. The mastermind behind this process is\u00a0Guy Chichignoud \u2013 CTO and cofounder of ROSI. \"Come with me.\" \"You can really feel the heat. You can really feel the heat. Wow!\" \"How hot does it get in there?\" \"400 degrees.\" \"400 degrees. That's really hot, so\u00a0we don\u2019t stay too close for long.\" The panels bake for between 1.5 and six\u00a0hours, turning the plastics inside into gas. \"What is really important when you look at this process? Does it depend on the temperature? How the panels are\u00a0stacked up? What makes the difference?\" \"What makes the difference and what is our\u00a0knowledge and IP protection is: of course, it\u2019s not a standard pyrolysis process. It\u2019s\u00a0customized and optimized for the treatment of solar panels. What we managed to do is to\u00a0improve the general regulation of the oven depending on the source materials. So, actually\u00a0the modules contribute to the process. It\u2019s not an oven with a payload. It\u2019s a combination of\u00a0the two. It's coupled. Meaning we use the energy from modules to heat up the oven, so we can save energy. So, it\u2019s a combination \u2014 the coupling between the machine,  the equipment, the oven and the payload. So, the combination of\u00a0the two makes it more efficient.\" ROSI sends hazardous gases and exhaust fumes through a five-stage filtering system. They say\u00a0only CO2 and water vapor are released in the end. But despite the CO2, recycling still saves\u00a0emissions compared to mining fresh silicon. Creating the base silicon from quartz, coal\u00a0and wood chips releases between 8 to 12 tons of CO2 per ton of silicon. ROSI says their recycling process only releases\u00a03 tons. A reduction of at least 5 tons of CO2 per ton of silicon. The company would not let us show you the solar panels going into the furnace. But this\u00a0is what the solar panels look like after being \"baked in the oven\". This batch is about 20 kilos and represents the content of one solar panel. \"You can see the glass. You can see the silicon\u00a0wafers, which are like super thin. Yeah. And you can just break them into pieces. Yeah. And then you've got the copper connectors...\" \"...copper ribbons.\" Now, this mess goes into the next range of machines that take on the sorting job. When you\u00a0look at a typical solar panel from the weight perspective, it\u2019s about 76% glass, 10% plastic, 8% aluminum, 5% silicon, 1% copper, and 0.1% silver.  And it\u2019s that really valuable silver that\u2019s the\u00a0main goal of this whole process. Though first, we need to extract the copper and glass. But\u2026 \"This whole process isn\u2019t the only way to recycle solar panels. Other companies are\u00a0trying it with mechanical recycling, for example. It\u2019s less energy-intensive, it costs less and you\u00a0do not need to deal with chemicals afterwards.\" However, the recovery rates can be lower. Firms like Solar Materials in Germany are using heat, like ROSI, at the start of\u00a0their process, but no chemical baths. \"In Japan, there is even one called the hot\u00a0blade method. And like the name suggests: a really hot and sharp knife is used to separate the glass from the rest.\" Another German company is  \u2014 putting it very,\u00a0very simply \u2014  hitting the solar panels with lightning. This bursts them into several\u00a0components which are then sortable. \"I don't think I can pick a\u00a0clear favorite right now.\" Marius Ian Peters has been researching\u00a0photovoltaics for more than 20 years and is concerned about how to deal with\u00a0all the plastics in the solar panels. \"I'm not exactly happy, for example, with a\u00a0thermal process in which the polymers are incinerated, because we would lose those polymers to go into a state for which the elements are still in there. Now, that being said, it is\u00a0very hard currently to take a polymer that's inside the solar panel, get it out of the\u00a0solar panel, and treat it in a way that we can reuse it as a polymer. It's very energy-intensive to do that. And it doesn't really compete  both energetically or economically, or ecologically, with making a new polymer.\" So, plastics are going to stay a pain to deal with, but what about the remaining materials after the mechanical sortation? \"Now, most of the materials are separated, but we still need to get out the most valuable\u00a0one that is still in these photovoltaic cells connected to the silicon: it's the silver.\" The thousands of pieces of photovoltaic cells in these containers go through a set\u00a0of five to eight chemical wet baths that are connected to each other. Here, the silicon and\u00a0the silver are separated from one another. \"It is these tiny tiny silver lines that we are\u00a0talking about here. Their job in a solar panel is to make the electricity available for direct\u00a0use or storage in a battery, for example.\" In case you\u2019re wondering, this is as\u00a0much of the process as we could show you. \"Can you specify a bit what kind of\u00a0chemicals you use? Because chemistry is, like, a really wide term.\" \"We avoid the use of organic solvents and strong acids, and we have\u00a0specific conditions  with different baths to treat the photovoltaic cells.\" That\u2019s as specific as they would get. Because we can\u2019t really show you the inside of the\u00a0process, we set it up a small experiment. So, you first have the photovoltaic cells as they\u00a0enter and, every step, you can see the silver fingers detach a little more. \"It's like really tiny, small fingers.\" \"Yes, it is very, very thin.\" \"Yeah, it almost looks like hair.\" \"Yeah.\" \"What's the purity on the silver and on the silicon that comes out of this?\" \"So, our processes in general enable [us] to keep the same purity for the material when they come in. So we don't degrade the purity. So, for example for the silver, it comes from silver paste on the cells and silver pastes are, in general, above 90% purity. For the silicon, it's 99.99%.\" \"Okay. That sounds quite pure.\" The recovered purity is in line with\u00a0scientifically published papers. But for the economics of the process another number is important: how much of the materials is actually recovered. With their combination of thermal and chemical recycling steps, ROSI says they are able\u00a0to recover 99% of the glass, aluminum and copper, 90% of the silicon and 95% of the silver. Which means that they get about  10 USD worth of silver out of each solar panel. The other stuff \u2014 glass, aluminum, copper and silicon \u2014 is worth another 10 bucks. But of course, the recovered\u00a0materials cost more than virgin materials. \"Do you have the feeling that companies\u00a0are willing to pay these premiums that you have for recycled material?\" \"Yeah, unfortunately, they don't pay big premium. But today all the big\u00a0companies, all big industrial companies in Europe have very strong targets on CO2 reduction and using recycled material is a very good way for them to reduce their CO2 emission from their\u00a0raw materials. So, already with silicon, for instance, the CO2 emissions of silicon production is very high. So, for our customers, it's crucial that they use less CO2 intensive materials. And\u00a0our silicon completely fulfills this target. I would\u2019ve loved to compare the prices for\u00a0recovered materials to actual market prices, but ROSI wouldn\u2019t tell me their numbers. Luckily\u00a0for them, in France there is a so-called gate fee that every solar importer or seller must pay\u00a0to recycling companies to make sure the panels are rightfully taken care of at their end\u00a0of life. Just to put this in perspective: a study by the US National Renewable Energy\u00a0Lab put the cost of trashing a solar panel at under $5, whereas recycling one would cost $15 to $45. So, how do you make recycling pay? ROSI say they can process around 3,000 tons of\u00a0solar panels per year here. Not really that much compared to the millions of tons of trash expected in the upcoming years. And it\u2019s not even enough for them to break even. But they're\u00a0already planning to build a facility 10 times bigger in Germany by the end of 2025. Which should\u00a0be able to handle 30,000 tons per year. However, upscaling such a process is a real challenge, as their CEO told me. \"For the very big-scale recycling site, we'll have to organize very well the operators, engineers, technicians, so all the traceability system, and also how to integrate the operators,  so human beings with\u00a0the automation, to reduce the cost to protect to maximum the safety of the site.\" \"Also, you can\u2019t use this recycled silicon straight away to form a new PV module.\" One of the reasons being: the technology moved on. Twenty, thirty years ago, silicon of 99.999%\u00a0purity was used. Sounds pretty pure. However, today silicon more than a thousand times purer\u00a0is required. So, you\u2019d need another purification process after this to create new silicon ingots and new wafers to put into new modules. This has been done on the science side. For\u00a0example, by Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Institute, a research body that works closely with industry partners. But ROSI is taking a different route and is selling its recovered materials to the\u00a0automotive, building and electronics industries. \"Another way to make this whole thing easier, and\u00a0that wouldn\u2019t require engineering the recycling process to perfection, is to redesign these\u00a0solar panels and make them easier to recycle.\" The Netherland Organisation for Applied\u00a0Scientific Research has developed what they call a \"release encapsulant\" where a type of\u00a0trigger is worked into the polymers that make them easier to get rid of during recycling. Like\u00a0pressing a button and everything goes poof. \"At the National Energy Laboratory in the US, they are taking things up a notch by getting rid of all the plastic. And they are doing this by literally welding glass together.\" That way you wouldn\u2019t need to deal with plastics used for encapsulation at all. But, of course, this is all still happening in the lab. Another promising tech could actually be perovskite solar cells, which I already did\u00a0a video on. Because the different layers of perovskite solar panels are created using\u00a0chemicals, they could also be taken apart easier  afterwards by using similar process steps. But they would need to be mass produced, first. \"What I can say is that the recycling process for ROSI is working at a pilot facility. But I\u2019m going to be honest with you: I expected to get to\u00a0know a lot more details about the process. I don\u2019t even know what chemicals they are using. And the\u00a0upscaling is going to be difficult as well. Not just from the process or technical side of things, but they also need to get the financing right. And everything at the same time? Not easy. Overall, bigger players with a lot deeper pockets will have to get involved to make recycling\u00a0solar panels at a larger scale a reality.\" \"If you did enjoy the video: like it,\u00a0comment on it, share it.

    "transcript": "No joke, but this place... has a serious issue with water. Water here has changed the course of war, started fights with neighboring countries, and dominates the city's political agenda. And yet, this country is a role model. \"Singapore got it right, as simple as that.\" This is how Singapore is transforming itself from one of the most water-stressed\u00a0countries in the world to self-sufficiency, from water rags \u2013 to riches. Welcome to Singapore! A vibrant multicultural city-state, right on the equator. Densely populated, around 6 million people live on this tiny island. It's an international hub for trade and finance. It's clean, safe, modern, wealthy, green. Basically, it has a lot of everything you'd want. There's just that one thing... Singapore has no natural freshwater resources. And the way its economy\u00a0and population are growing, total water demand could almost double by 2060. But Singapore is on it. \"None of what they've done is magic.\" That's Peter Gleick, he's an\u00a0award-winning water expert. He puts Singapore's success down to what he calls the \"soft path\" approach to their problems. \"So the soft path for water is\u00a0in contrast to what we have done over the last century and more, more than a century, the hard path. To build hard infrastructure, to take\u00a0more and more water out of nature, to ignore the consequences of\u00a0our water policies for nature, to build narrow institutions. And the soft path tries to\u00a0turn that around and say, let's use water efficiently and carefully. Let's stop wasting water. Let's look at new sources of supply.\" To understand how Singapore can pull this off, you first need to understand\u00a0where they're coming from. \"The Singapore water story\u00a0starts with World War 2.\" That's Jon Church, the guy for\u00a0water at the United Nations. Singaporeans would argue that\u00a0the story goes back a lot longer, but 1942 is certainly when the\u00a0issue grabbed the world's attention. That's when allied troops, namely British, Australian and Indian forces, were battling fascist Japan on Singapore Island, which at the time was a British colony. The allies depended on imported water which was a bit of a problem when Japanese forces blew up the pipes transporting that water. \"The bridge that connects\u00a0Malaysia and Singapore was bombed. The result was lack of water in the city, a terrible episode of water scarcity.\" The Allies lost the battle of Singapore, but after Japan's overall surrender, the island remained in British hands. It took more than 20 years until\u00a0it became fully independent. But political liberation didn't free\u00a0Singapore from its water crisis: water rationing, catastrophic sanitation, and regular floods continued. With its fate now in its own hands, Singapore began planning for the long-term. Cecilia Tortajada has spent almost three decades researching water policy and\u00a0innovations around the world and is fascinated by Singapore's path. \"When Singapore became independent, they started planning to be water independent, as well as food independent, energy independent, but to have systems that can sustain stress. That was in 1965 for 2060.\" Their initial masterplan was\u00a0fine-tuned over the years into a water strategy which they\u00a0call their \"4 national taps\". First: Water imports Second: Desalination Third: Local Catchment And fourth, something they call \"NEWater\". Let's dive into it! Firstly, Singapore knew there was plenty of water, right here: Two deals to import water\u00a0from Malaysia in the 60's, got the taps running again. It's cheap and millions of liters are pumped over the border every day. But buying half your water from your neighbor isn't sustainable long-term. On the contrary: From the start, Malaysia made threats to cut off the supply and argued over its price. The tensions have even led to\u00a0warnings of a military conflict. Singapore's leaders know their weak spot, so they want to stop importing water by 2061. So, it's all the more important that the other three taps become\u00a0more than a drop in the ocean. \"Water planning is very important because they have so little water, Singapore must make sure, that\u00a0this water is used wisely. And the objective of this master plan is to make the most out of every single drop of water.\" This means keeping rivers and drains clean, investing billions, starting to collect more water, cleaning it and use what the\u00a0island state Singapore already has. For example, this: The ocean! \"Desalination, Desalination, Desalination. You take that undrinkable salt water, you remove the salt and you have an unlimited supply of fresh water.\" Do you remember? We had an entire video about obtaining fresh water through desalination. It's used in a number of extremely\u00a0dry places around the world and is a real gamechanger for some. \"Membrane desalination uses pressure. Salt water, here coloured in red for clarity, is pressed through a membrane that is only partially permeable. Fresh water can press through. Here coloured in blue. But the salt is trapped on the other side.\" Singapore really pushed to\u00a0advance this technology. This underground facility for\u00a0example is state-of-the-art. Normally, it treats used water. In times of drought, it desalinates sea water. On top, people use it as a park. Today, five desalination plants provide up to 25 % of the entire island's water supply. Singapore plans increase this capacity to meet 30% of its needs in 2060, by which time water use is\u00a0expected to have doubled. But that's no way near self-sufficiency. So, what's next? Bingo! Rain! A lot of it, and Singapore is\u00a0a master of maxing that out. Two third of the entire state's surface is\u00a0used for rainwater catchment. \"Basically, the water falls on the roof and then goes through drains\u00a0and then you make sure that as little water leaks from the drains and is captured by the drainage system and conveyed to reservoirs where it can be stored. And treated for further use. An extensive network of rivers, canals and drains channels the water into 17 reservoirs. The biggest is Marina Barrage, with an area of 10,000 hectares. It holds back fresh water\u00a0from flowing into the ocean. And helps to control frequent floods. So does this underground tank that catches floodwater in extreme cases when the drains spill over. Even this water could potentially\u00a0be treated and reused. By 2060, the government wants to use 90% of the land area for rain catchment. Catching rainwater is one thing, but what about the water already in circulation? \"All drainage water is collected, and treated and reused as much as possible. Most countries, they do not\u00a0invest, not even a fraction of what Singapore is investing.\" The water authorities built a 206\u00a0kilometer sewage pipe-highway, costing 10 billion dollars that guides the city's sewage into state-of-the-art reclamation\u00a0and cleaning facilities. Ok, Singapore is by some measures the 5th richest country in the world so it can afford to splash out like that. It's also a lot easier to\u00a0push through such projects when you have the sort of \"controlled democracy\", run by the same party, that Singapore has had since independence in 1965. Anyway, the entire city's underground is basically one big sewer network. But the pride of Singapore's water strategy is what happens after collecting the water \u2013 the treatment. The authorities call it NEWater. It's produced by microfiltration, reverse osmosis and UV radiation. \"Some of that water is so high quality, Singapore is using it in their\u00a0chip manufacturing industry, which requires ultra-pure water, which is an indication of how\u00a0good a quality of that water is.\" Did you know, that around the world, half of our wastewater is released untreated? And only 11% is actually reused. In Singapore about 30% percent of the entire drinkable and non-drinkable demand can be met by recycling used water. And they want to increase that to 55% by 2060. Most of it is used by industry, only a fraction of it is mixed\u00a0into the drinking water supply, because we're all so squeamish. \"It's controversial because\u00a0we're taking wastewater which, you know, goes down our drains, we flush it down our toilets, industry dumps wastewater. And\u00a0we typically think of that as a, a liability, as something to get rid of.\" So how do you get people on board? \"Using the flush saver cistern bag and save with every flush!\" \"Make saving water pay!\" \"Reduce water consumption!\" \"Save up to 10 liters of water per hour!\" Nationwide campaigns encourage people to install water-saving fittings. And nicely, if you install those fittings, you get discount vouchers for\u00a0other sustainable products. Digital water meters track each household's water consumption and detect leaks in pipes. That's how Singapore comes down to an incredible 5% water loss from leaks. Which is first class. Globally, the average is estimated to be 30%. \"What they've done incredibly well, in my opinion, is on the side of water education. They've educated their community\u00a0about their water situation, about their water challenges, and about the solutions\u00a0that they've chosen to push.\" As good as Singapore is doing, it has big advantages over other countries. Besides being rich and a\u00a0tightly-controlled society, the city only has a tiny agricultural sector and can focus almost entirely on urban and industrial wastewater. So, they have one problem less as food production pollutes and\u00a0consumes enormous amounts of fresh water in many parts of the world. Despite that, they've shown: a lot is possible. \"Everywhere in the world, when\u00a0we start, again talking about water -  when we see our management,\u00a0how can it be improved? Who would be involved? How can we pay for it? There is always a \"but\". \"But\" can we do it? And in Singapore it's not. In Singapore it's: how is it that we are going to do it? So, it's a very different\u00a0perspective, its proactive. They move very fast. So once a decision has been taken the things start happening.\" So, to sum up: Incentivizing low-cost water-saving fittings could be easy for every government to implement. Desalination is only an option for coastal regions and it requires a lot of energy,\u00a0often dirty fossil fuels. Singapore's catchment, treatment\u00a0and purification facilities are world class, as the result of a lot of investment\u00a0in innovation and research. \"But it turns out that a dollar invested in an efficiency improvement is much more productive than a\u00a0dollar invested in new supply.\" Reusing wastewater seems a no-brainer. It's safe and tested to work\u00a0and the tech is available. \"This is really important\u00a0to find the best solutions to every country's problems, but also long-term planning. Singapore, from all the way from\u00a0\nindependence has been planning its way through water security. In Singapore it's extremely\u00a0high on the political agenda, all the way up to the Prime Minister. It's something which is mainstreamed in each and every policy adopted and implemented by the country.\" Singapore is blazing a trail in tackling some of the world's biggest water challenges in the face of climate change. It's not just about money, but also about decision-making, policy and long-term planning. Some of the ingredients with which any region could make\u00a0it from water rags to riches."

    "transcript": "Can this give traditional cheese a run for its money? Creamy camembert that hasn't used milk from a cow. Slaughter-free steaks and chicken breast grown from cells. All that's been promised for a while now: a food revolution. Not only would it be free of animal cruelty, it would also help solve the environmental crisis by reducing the amount of land, water and grain we need to feed animals for our food. Some countries and US states have even pre-emptively banned it, concerned it could phase out traditional agriculture. But that's kind of the point: the livestock industry accounts for a fairly large share of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. \"We are running on a highway to hell.\" Lab-grown products could put us on the road to redemption. But how are they made and when will they actually hit our supermarket shelves? This place - Formo - is as modern and trendy as you'd expect from a Berlin startup. The only difference here is that instead of brewing beer, they're brewing cheese. Formo is the brainchild of Raffa Wohlgensinger. He wants to be at the forefront of a food revolution, which is no easy task. \"Changing food is multi-layered in a sense, because it's so deeply ingrained in our culture and who we are.\" Formo ferment their cheeses with whey-like proteins in a traditional cheese factory. And they've just started\u00a0selling them within Germany. Then there's cultured meat, grown from animal cells, The Israeli firm Aleph Farms say their beef steaks are close to being rolled out. \"Yes, our product is ready to go. The quality and level of sensory properties, mainly taste, flavor and texture is very high.\" To be honest, it feels like we've been here before. So what's different now? The first cultured meat arrived in the form of a burger back in 2013, but the costs were eye-watering, rather than mouth-watering. Then came the wave of plant-based vegan cheese and fake meats. They sold pretty well initially, though some big brands have experienced a downturn in sales in 2024. But none of that has dented the world's appetite for meat and dairy, as consumption continues to grow across the planet. As parts of the world increase their financial standing, they're also increasing their meat intake. Though data does show the Western world is still culpable for the lion's share. \"In the Western world, we have to remember that and shift again to a situation where we eat more plant-based food.\" That's Tilo H\u00fchn, a food tech professor at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences. He believes plant-based alternatives are a good addition to the food industry, but admits they don't seem to have convinced everyone. \"If Elvis Presley steps through the door, I know that this is not Elvis. It could be that he performs even as good as Elvis. But I know it couldn't be that Elvis stands in my office.\" \"It's got to feel like: I'm not limiting, I'm not making a sacrifice. We need to get the ones who say, 'I just want to have great freaking food'.\" Instead of using oils or nuts to replicate the fat from milk, Formo has focused on creating proteins which mimic whey and use that in a traditional cheese-making process. The taste test is coming up, but first let's dive into why this quest to find alternatives exists in the first place. Just how much the livestock industry contributes to climate-warming greenhouse gases depends on who you ask. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization's most recent report cited 12%, but other studies suggest figures as high as 20%. Whatever the number, climate scientists consider methane emissions particularly concerning, they can be 80 times more harmful in terms of heating the atmosphere than CO2. And livestock accounts for about 30% of the world's methane emissions, largely through cow burps. Deforestation, land and water use, and livestock feed are also major concerns. \"It's not only the production of meat, it's the overall production of food loss and food waste in the whole system and overuse of resources. It makes more sense to produce plants and eat it directly than to feed it to animals.\" An early study by Oxford University in 2011 reported cultivated meat could produce up to 96% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than livestock, thanks to using less land, water and feed. But the numbers here are also contested. Some studies claim cultivated meat and dairy will need to be run on renewable energy sources if they are to retain lower emissions. So we know the world needs to change something about its eating habits. But that taste and texture of meat and dairy is something that many people are unwilling to give up, no matter the cost. To come closer to actual dairy, Formo uses what's called precision fermentation, the evolution of a process dating back thousands of years. They take Koji, a type of fungi which is used a lot in Japanese cuisine, feed and ferment it to create a protein similar to whey, and then turn it into cheese. The company also plans on using an animal-free casein protein, but that first needs EU approval. A product like cheese, it is already a processed product when you start with milk. There is a fermentation process already involved in the regular production of the product. There I think it's easier to say, 'Hey, there's just another fermentation step before that,' to kind of get people to convert, in that sense.\" \"The Holy Trinity is probably taste, texture and then cost. We'll get to cost in a moment but maybe we should just dig straight in and see how we go with taste and texture.\" \"So that's like a Frischk\u00e4se? A better version of cream cheese.\" \"Correct, correct, correct.\" \"Yeah, you see like, really creamy.\" \"That's actually pretty good.\" \"Right?\" \"Then we have like a Greek feta cheese.\" \"So this one, I'd say the texture is a little bit still away from what you would expect from a feta. But the taste, like the saltiness and everything, it's really there.\" \"Then we have a brie-like, white-mold cheese, fresh cheese.\" \"The texture is 100% there with the creaminess. That texture is a lot better than some bries that I buy in the supermarket.\" So the cheese checks out. But what about that third component in the Holy Trinity - price? Raffa says it will initially be 10-20% more expensive than mid-range cheese. So we're still talking luxury prices for most people, but it's not outrageously expensive either. And Raffa claims Formo's cheese will eventually sell for cheaper than traditional dairy. \"Fermentation is just more efficient with resources than animals, much more efficient actually... The question of the cost and the price, pretty much, is only a factor of scale.\" Alright, that's the cheese. But what about that highly sought-after steak? There are quite a few companies out there working on cultured meat: from beef, to chicken, to fish, to foie gras. Aleph Farms is just one of a handful that already have approval to sell their lab-grown meat - in their case in Israel. The company said they will roll it out within the next year. But admitted it will be a luxury item to begin with, sold in high-end restaurants at a price similar to premium-range beef. \"It might take 10 years to get to the mainstream market. It will not happen overnight. Just because it takes time to build production capacity, to drive the cost down, to build the supply chain.\" Studies show customers are still skeptical about how this \"meat\" is made. Aleph Farms says they are following the same basic principles of fermentation, only they start with animal cells, feed and nurture them in a bioreactor, until they replicate only the edible part of animals. \"We do eat cells from cows when we eat meat products. So it's the same cells, the same ancient time-honored cell cultivation technique, and we just merge the two to make a new combination. The cells we use are not genetically engineered.\" The quest to develop the perfect steak or the creamiest camembert is, of course, just half the battle. Because before these products have even hit the shelves, they're receiving a lot of blowback behind the scenes. Italy's parliament moved to ban the production, sale or import of cultivated meat and animal feed in 2023. The US states of Florida and Alabama followed suit with their own bans in 2024. \"I love that they banned it, because that shows it's real. Why would you ban something that you don't believe is going to become relevant in the marketplace? So it's also a great signal, I think that says, like: 'Damn, big meat is really concerned with this. The farming lobby is really concerned about that.'\" The reasoning from politicians is that traditional agriculture has to be protected. These instances of allegedly protecting the traditional agriculture is also selling very well in terms of elections, even beyond the farming industry. A lot of people are connected emotionally to agriculture and traditional agriculture. The transition away from traditional agriculture is clearly a sensitive topic. It's estimated that 857 million people worldwide work in the industry. Which is why many countries subsidize farming. The EU will provide about 387 billion euros in agriculture policy funds between 2021 and 2027. \"We are obviously playing on a completely uneven playing ground. I'm not even arguing for: 'We need support to lower the price of our products.' I'm not even arguing for products who emit a lot of emissions need to be priced harder. I'm just saying, give everybody the same. And then I have full conviction that this technology is more efficient, it will be cheaper and it performs great. And consumers will make the choices based on that.\" This all comes as traditional agriculture is facing major issues, as we covered in this report: In the EU, just 12% of farm managers are under the age of 40, with almost 60% aged 55 or above, meaning many could retire in the next decade. Climate change is also already affecting livestock farms. Those in Sicily, for example, are struggling amid prolonged drought and record-high temperatures. This is also one area where Formo are conscious of finding solutions which combine the old with the new. \"We're speaking with the traditional dairy and farming industry. Because also in this technology, it's not like, you know, farming, traditional farming, as we know it, won't play any role anymore. To do that, to grow proteins in a fermentation tank and to produce these products, you need nutrients. Nutrients are coming from our fields. So you will always have traditional farming as you know it.\" Cultured meat is still some way away from being a legitimate alternative for the mainstream. But Formo has just shown me that animal-free cheese is here. It may not compare to the best bio French cheese you've ever had in your life, but it definitely rivals those found in German supermarkets. Of course, simply eating more beans and veg is another way of substituting animal products. And the market for these animal-free alternatives is still very small. But if they can convince consumers' tastebuds and bank balances, more people may jump on board - which can only be good news for the world's climate. Would you tuck into lab-grown food?

    "transcript": "Germany has a problem with floods. \"A state of emergency has been declared in parts of the South.\" \"...the deadliest floods in living memory.\" \"Germany saw its heaviest rainfall in a century.\"  One big reason is that we\u2019ve messed  with the natural flow of rivers. And this isn\u2019t just a German problem. The same thing is happening all over the world. And now we\u2019re paying the price. As climate change brings more extreme weather, these changed landscapes are more prone to destructive flooding. \"But in this forest, things are different. It\u2019s become a role model for how we can flood-proof our rivers  \u2014 even in cities.\" \"So, how did they do that?\" Rivers aren\u2019t supposed to look like this. Today, many of them are straight, narrow, deep, depleted and surrounded by concrete. That\u2019s because humans have a long history of changing rivers and their landscapes so they can use them for farming, industry, transportation and to build houses close to their edge. \"This river here is a great example of how we have messed with our landscapes. As you can see, it\u2019s been straightened, regulated, and diked. Also, parts of the floodplains on its sides, which would usually provide space for overflowing water, have been drained and filled.\" The rivers and floodplains in this area serve an important function, though. They cross the cities of Leipzig, Markkleeberg, and Schkeuditz and are supposed to store and supply water to one of the largest urban floodplain forests in Central Europe that is home to many animals and plant species. But from the middle of the 19th century, dams and bridges for railroads were built here \u2014 right through the forest. And during that process, former river courses\u202fin this area were cut off and are now lying dry. And all this means they can no longer supply water to the floodplain forest. \"And that\u2019s not just happening here...\" Around two thirds of the floodplains along Germany\u2019s 79 major rivers can no longer serve their original purpose of storing excess water because of the dikes built to stop water from reaching them. One third of the remaining floodplain areas are covered by fields and houses. And it\u2019s happening across Europe, where 70-90% of floodplains have been environmentally degraded. Asia and the Americas are also struggling with depleted floodplains. \"So why is that a problem?\" Floodplains are not only important ecosystems. They also absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere, helping tackle climate change. And, maybe most importantly for the people who live along the rivers: they keep flash floods in check. \"Functioning floodplain forests are very, very important for us because they retain water in the landscape for a longer period. It means that we have this crucial sponge function.\" That\u2019s Mathias Scholz, a floodplain ecologist. He\u2019s been studying the role of rivers and coastal wetlands for decades. \"If we no longer have floodplains and floodplain forests, water flows out of the landscape very, very quickly, leading  to increasingly large flood waves that cause significant damage. This damage is enormously high for society.\" That\u2019s why Scholz \u2014 together with the cities of Leipzig and Schkeuditz, the University of Leipzig and the environmental association NABU \u2014 decided to give the floodplain landscape here a more natural face again. \"Forty years ago, we already noticed that this floodplain forest was undergoing a process of expansion. Many trees developed here that are no longer flood-resistant, displacing the tree species typically found in the floodplain forest.\" \"Oak trees like this one and elm trees like this one started to die off, while other species that are a lot less resilient to flooding, like maple, started to spread.\" \"When the floodplain dries out, the sycamore maple, which grows right next to it, takes over. You can see it very clearly here; it also produces a white milky sap. And then the other species find it really difficult to compete.\" \"And the other species are the ones  that actually protect us against flooding?\" \"Exactly, because those species are highly resistant to flooding.\"  That\u2019s because those species can handle being flooded better than others. They can also handle droughts better. And they suck moisture out of the soil, which decreases the amount of water contributing to flash flooding events. So, the researchers had an idea. They started purposely flooding a small area of the forest every spring for decades. And watched what happened. \"We realized that we can maintain moist conditions in the forest for up to 3 months longer, even during drought periods, allowing the floodplain forest to adapt to these wetter, more dynamic conditions. At the same time, other species that do not belong here receded, providing space and light for tree species typical of the floodplain forest.\" They literally trained the forest to be able to soak up more water again. \"Even if trees are flood-resistant, if they do not experience flooding for a long time, they may 'forget' how to cope with it or adapt to it.\" Scholz says the data they collected over 30 years tells the story of an ecosystem going back to its natural state. This is a 3D model of a 7-hectare forest area that they flooded and surveyed for three decades. Just look at how many red trees there were before they started flooding the area \u2014 those are untypical, sometimes invasive species that are not so resilient to floods and drought. And now look how many green trees came back once they started flooding the area. Those are typical, native floodplain trees, which are resistant to floods and droughts. \"Here you can clearly see how the maple is dying. This area has been underwater for several weeks. And right next to it is the flood-tolerant European ash, which looks very healthy.\" They were surprised by how fast the forest went back to its natural state once they started adjusting the water levels. \"For us, these are nature-based solutions to mitigate the extreme events we expect from climate change.\" \"So, how exactly did they flood the area?\" \"As early as the late 1990s,  the city of Leipzig began reconnecting old channel systems in the floodplain, like this one here, the Burgauenbach, to the main water bodies so that the forest could receive water again.\" That\u2019s Reiner Werner, who is the head of hydraulic engineering and water management. \"We reconnected the still existing  old historical channel systems, meaning we had to restore this ditch here by hand in part. And then we built an inlet structure to channel water through the dike back into these channel systems.\" They then cut out several parts of the dike on the river side so that the water can naturally overflow into the floodplain. \"We are seeing clear results with the increase in groundwater levels, which have been documented. Significant results are visible and quantifiable in the forest in a very short time, even with such a small water body.\" \"Back then, it was easy to get a permit for an undertaking like that.\" \"Today, it is much more complicated. There are new guidelines, EU regulations, that must be followed. Much more evidence and estimates are required. It is not as simple as it used to be.\" But that didn\u2019t stop the city from doing more. It brought together scientists, NGOs and local officials in 2018 to come up with a concept to rejuvenate the entire floodplain over the next 30 years. \"And they just finished their first project. They restored this historic riverbed here and designed it in a way that it can overflow more naturally, regularly and predictably \u2014 like it did in the past before we altered rivers.\" \"As you can see very well here, we have moved the field relatively far away from the forest edge, creating a huge corridor where the waters can meander freely.\" That\u2019s Christiane Frohberg, who was responsible for revitalizing this old riverbed. \"We have several exit points where, when the flood comes, the water can rise and then flow over this very shallow bank directly into the forest. This means that with the newly gained 5.5 kilometers, which we only finished constructing this year, we can flood approximately 45 hectares of floodplain forest several times a year.\" That\u2019s roughly the size of 84 football fields. \"And that\u2019s also good news for the animals who live here.\" Fish and rare species of insects have already settled in. \"But it wasn\u2019t easy to get to this point.\" It\u2019s a tricky process to find a balance between flooding the forest enough so it relearns how to suck up more water \u2014 and not overflooding it, otherwise the water could permanently stay there like in a bathtub, which would change the entire ecosystem. And you have to consider different interests. \"We are in a major city, which means there are many interests and uses for the forest, with recreational use being very important. This means that if we flood certain areas and some paths become inaccessible in the spring during high water, we need to provide information, raise awareness, or offer alternatives. However, we have found that there is also a very high level of acceptance among the population, who deal with the situation very creatively.\" \"I am so very happy right now. Yes, because it was simply years of talking to people every day, ensuring that they are not afraid when a bit of water comes in here. And it's just wonderful to see that we now have water in this small river, which nevertheless  has a significant impact.\" It\u2019s not just people using the forest for recreational purposes who needed to be convinced about the flooding plans. Local farmers had to be onboard as well. \"You can't simply expropriate people without offering alternatives. Bringing more water into the landscape doesn\u2019t necessarily mean giving up agricultural use; it just means that agricultural practices need to be adapted. So, this means that a transition from arable land to a wild meadow ultimately has to happen, but this change must also be appropriately compensated.\" That means instead of planting corn and rapeseed on all of their land, farmers would plant grass in some areas and sell the hay instead. They would also receive a compensation payment, Scholz says. The goal for the next 10-15 years is to revitalize more than 16 km of former arms along the river. They want to reconnect dried-up river arms and inundate at least 30% of the floodplain area via the new river, so that instead of this\u2026 the area will look like this. \"And here, they already started turning  former farmland into a floodplain forest.\" They planted species resilient to flooding so that future flood waters can be sucked up by the plants like a sponge. That way, Scholz says they can also get more water to stay in the ground. Of course, projects like this come with a hefty price tag. The city of Leipzig already spent 6.5 million euros \u2013 largely funded by the German state \u2013 to buy back land and build new bridges and gateways for crossing the newly restored river. \"It will require a truly great effort to get this project approved here in the region and by the permitting authorities, so that further steps can be taken for the preservation of the floodplain forest, and to secure funding in the tens of millions.\" It sounds like a lot \u2013 but flooding is actually the most expensive natural hazard in Europe... with one study estimating that river-based flood risk could increase seven-fold to \u20ac6.8 billion by the end of this century. Most large European cities are situated on floodplains... these are the ones that are predicted to suffer a lot of flood damages in the future. And the changes we\u2019ve made to most of our waterways are adding to the flood risk... not detracting from it. That\u2019s why EU Environmental Ministers recently approved a contested Nature Restoration Law that seeks to regrow forests, re-wet peatland and return rivers to their natural, free-flowing states. A move that Scholz welcomes. \"When we consider the monetary damage that extreme events ultimately inflict on our society and the long-term efforts required to address them, it becomes clear that investing in ecosystem restoration is a future-proof investment.\" That\u2019s why more and more European cities situated in floodplains are experimenting with nature-based approaches like this. And the project here in Leipzig has become a blueprint for others. Scholz has been cooperating with colleagues from Estonia, Spain and Portugal to share knowledge and best practices, such as how to retain water in an area as long as possible. \"And there\u2019s a lot that other countries can learn from their success.\" \"Above all, it's important to get the landowners and tenants, the farmers, and the foresters on board, and to make decisions together with them on-site, and not just the planners at the drawing board.\" \"When nature functions properly, it works for us, and we can benefit from nature's services. And that\u2019s an insurance policy for the future.\" \"So, do you think this nature-based approach could work where you live?

A lot.\u00a0\nWe wouldn\u2019t be here without it, of course,\u00a0\u00a0 seeing as how it\u2019s the element that\u2019s\u00a0\nbeen keeping our star burning for the\u00a0\u00a0 last 4.6 billion years or so, and will keep\u00a0\nit glowing brightly for another 5 billion.\u00a0 It also has all sorts of useful applications here\u00a0\non earth. Among other things, as a feedstock for\u00a0\u00a0 various chemicals like methanol , as part of\u00a0\nhydrogenation processes to convert unsaturated\u00a0\u00a0 hydrocarbons into saturated hydrocarbons in the\u00a0\nproduction of edible oils, as a reducing agent in\u00a0\u00a0 steelmaking, and of course to produce the ammonia\u00a0\nthat forms a key part of the fertilizers that make\u00a0\u00a0 our current food growing practices possible.\nBut setting fire to it to heat your home and\u00a0\u00a0 cook your food? Meh, maybe not so much!\nHello and welcome to Just Have a Think\u00a0 When it comes to hydrogen, there are plenty of\u00a0\npeople far more experienced and knowledgeable\u00a0\u00a0 than me who have waded into the debate\u00a0\nabout whether the lightest element in\u00a0\u00a0 the universe can play any meaningful role\u00a0\nin the direct replacement of fossil fuels.\u00a0 One of those people is Michael Liebreich,\u00a0\nwho has spent many years researching the\u00a0\u00a0 appropriate uses for H2, and has produced\u00a0\nthe now very well-publicised Hydrogen Ladder,\u00a0\u00a0 outlining all proposed applications, ranging from\u00a0\nessential stuff right on the top rung, all the way\u00a0\u00a0 down to fanciful folly at the bottom. And you\u2019ll\u00a0\nnotice that right down there on the so-called\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018uncompetitive rung\u2019 we have \u2018Domestic Heating\u2019.\nSo, why is that then? After all, we\u2019ve all heard\u00a0\u00a0 about various trials of hydrogen for home\u00a0\nheating, and possibly even for cooking,\u00a0\u00a0 haven\u2019t we? Most of them sponsored by\u00a0\nthe incumbent gas network operators,\u00a0\u00a0 by the way. And that kind of gives us a clue as to\u00a0\nthe possible motivation behind such proposals. If\u00a0\u00a0 we can keep the existing vast networks of gas\u00a0\npipelines, so the argument goes, then surely\u00a0\u00a0 we can just pump hydrogen through those pipes\u00a0\ninstead of methane gas, and hey presto, we\u2019ve\u00a0\u00a0 got a carbon free, drop in replacement and we\u2019ve\u00a0\nsolved the climate emergency in one fell swoop.\u00a0 Which brings me nicely to a second leading\u00a0\nfigure in the hydrogen debate \u2013 a chemical\u00a0\u00a0 engineer from Toronto, Canada, by the name of\u00a0\nPaul Martin. Full disclosure here \u2013 Paul is\u00a0\u00a0 a friend of the channel and someone with whom\u00a0\nI have discussed the ins and outs of hydrogen\u00a0\u00a0 several times over recent years. He\u2019s spent about\u00a0\n30 years designing, building and testing pilot,\u00a0\u00a0 demonstration and first commercial plants in the\u00a0\npetrochemical industry, specialising in the use\u00a0\u00a0 of hydrogen as a process chemical and really\u00a0\ndelving into the nuts and bolts of engineering\u00a0\u00a0 challenges across hundreds of projects.\nSo, he knows his onions when it comes to\u00a0\u00a0 hydrogen and, along with a group\u00a0\nof similarly learned colleagues,\u00a0\u00a0 he recently published this peer reviewed paper\u00a0\noutlining the challenges of converting an\u00a0\u00a0 existing natural gas system over to hydrogen.\nIt takes three litres of hydrogen to produce\u00a0\u00a0 the same amount of heat as one litre of methane.\nTo move a gas down a pipe, you have to compress\u00a0\u00a0 the gas. That's where the energy to overcome the\u00a0\nfriction of the gas flowing down the pipe comes\u00a0\u00a0 from, comes from compressors. And if you have to\u00a0\ncompress three litres of gas, irrespective of its\u00a0\u00a0 density, instead of compressing a litre of another\u00a0\ngas, that takes three times as much energy.\u00a0 So, the problem that you have when you try\u00a0\nto repurpose a pipe of a given size for a\u00a0\u00a0 different commodity is that it's not economic\u00a0\nto move hydrogen at three times the velocity\u00a0 So in fact, what you would do is you would\u00a0\nnever do that. You would derate the pipes\u00a0\u00a0 carrying capacity. So instead of delivering\u00a0\na thousand joules a minute of natural gas,\u00a0\u00a0 you'd have it deliver three or four\u00a0\nor 500 joules a minute of hydrogen.\u00a0 But \u2018hang on\u2019, say the proponents of hydrogen.\u00a0\nThose are all big engineering challenges for sure,\u00a0\u00a0 but if we can avoid the greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0\nfrom the combustion of fossil fuels by burning\u00a0\u00a0 hydrogen instead, then it must surely be\u00a0\nworth all the additional effort, right?\u00a0 Well, there\u2019s a bit more bad news there\u00a0\nas well, I\u2019m afraid. Let\u2019s start with\u00a0\u00a0 the way most hydrogen is currently produced\nSo, first of all hydrogen today is made from\u00a0\u00a0 methane and coal, largely. And it's also made\u00a0\na little bit from petroleum. And it's made for\u00a0\u00a0 use for its unique properties as a chemical. And\u00a0\nalmost nobody burns it on purpose. So, we don't\u00a0\u00a0 waste it as a fuel because it's made from a fuel.\nAnd 99% of the hydrogen in the world is made\u00a0\u00a0 from fossils. And the CO2 is\u00a0\njust dumped to the atmosphere.\u00a0 And in the process of making it, you lose energy.\u00a0\nSo, if you put in one joule of energy in the form\u00a0\u00a0 of natural gas into a steam methane reformer, you\u00a0\nmight get 0.7 joules worth of hydrogen out of it,\u00a0\u00a0 but you get all one joules worth of\u00a0\nCO2 in the atmosphere, plus all the\u00a0\u00a0 methane leakage and all the other bad stuff.\nSo, this is what I call the decarbonization\u00a0\u00a0 problem of hydrogen, which is a problem\u00a0\nthat must be solved because its emissions,\u00a0\u00a0 the CO2 and methane emissions associated with\u00a0\nhydrogen production, are actually greater than\u00a0\u00a0 those of the whole aviation industry right now.\u00a0\nNow, when we're talking about futures, people are\u00a0\u00a0 talking about futures, dreamland futures, I would\u00a0\nsay, without economic basis, where we're going to\u00a0\u00a0 be taking electricity and using it to break water\u00a0\napart into hydrogen and oxygen and then we're\u00a0\u00a0 going to be shipping that hydrogen around and then\u00a0\nusing it for purposes of energy like using it as\u00a0\u00a0 a fuel for vehicles or heating or the like and I\u00a0\nthink those aren't really fantasies they're more\u00a0\u00a0 nightmares because they're super expensive and\u00a0\nnot very practical and unfortunately, the hope\u00a0\u00a0 around those sorts of futures is being used to\u00a0\ndelay real decarbonization, which, you know, if\u00a0\u00a0 you ask a smart engineer about it, they're going\u00a0\nto say, well, the obvious thing to do instead is\u00a0\u00a0 to use the electricity to do whatever you were\u00a0\ngoing to do with the hydrogen as the electricity\u00a0\u00a0 will do it more efficiently and at lower cost.\nBut the main issue with hydrogen in gas networks\u00a0\u00a0 is really one of practicality. Methane gas is\u00a0\ntypically distributed via very long transmission\u00a0\u00a0 pipelines, or liquified to be sent across oceans.\nSo, what actually happens is in a pipeline that's\u00a0\u00a0 made out of strong steels that are hard, the\u00a0\npipeline flexes, it gets a little bit bigger\u00a0\u00a0 when you put higher pressure into it, and then\u00a0\nit shrinks back down again when the pressure\u00a0\u00a0 drops again. And that happens every day as people\u00a0\nare using gas and sometimes several times a day.\u00a0 And that causes fatigue.The trouble with\u00a0\nhydrogen is it gets into the metal matrix\u00a0\u00a0 and it causes fatigue cracks to grow much faster.\u00a0\nIt prevents the healing that used to happen. So,\u00a0\u00a0 two microscopic parts of metal separate and\u00a0\nhydrogen gets in between them and prevents\u00a0\u00a0 them from sticking together again. And so, it acts\u00a0\nkind of as a prop that causes the crack to grow.\u00a0 You know, it's just like, well, a dangerous thing\u00a0\nto put in your gas network if you value your pipe,\u00a0\u00a0 because soon it will be cracked\u00a0\nand leaking, and that would be bad.\u00a0 When natural gas arrives in our towns and cities,\u00a0\nit gets delivered to you and me via a network of\u00a0\u00a0 low to medium pressure underground pipes made\u00a0\nfrom a range of materials including mild steel,\u00a0\u00a0 cast-iron and high-density-polyethylene, or HDPE.\nHydrogen molecules can get through HDPE quite\u00a0\u00a0 easily. They can also leak through other soft\u00a0\nareas like gaskets and seals. So that\u2019s not ideal,\u00a0\u00a0 is it? Research suggests that the leakage rate\u00a0\nof hydrogen through plastic pipes could be as\u00a0\u00a0 much as four to five times higher than methane,\u00a0\ndepending on flow rates and local conditions.\u00a0 At the point where the pipelines reach our\u00a0\nhomes, network operators would have to replace\u00a0\u00a0 every domestic gas meter with new equipment\u00a0\nto measure volumetric flows that would need\u00a0\u00a0 to be about three times higher to deliver the same\u00a0\nenergy content. Those new meters would also have\u00a0\u00a0 to eliminate the large elastomeric or polymeric\u00a0\ncomponents used in existing diaphragm-type meters\u00a0\u00a0 that have been known to under-report flowrate\u00a0\nwhen fed gas mixtures containing hydrogen.\u00a0\u00a0 Then there\u2019s storage. Remember those big old\u00a0\ngasometers that we used to have on the edges\u00a0\u00a0 of our urban conurbations when town gas was\u00a0\nwidely used? You know, the ones that used to\u00a0\u00a0 go up and down all the time? They were there\u00a0\nto take up the slack in supply and demand.\u00a0 These days that slack is predominantly\u00a0\ntaken up by the pressurised gas sitting\u00a0\u00a0 in the pipeline network itself.\nIt\u2019s called \u2018Line Pack\u2019 , and it\u00a0\u00a0 serves as a vital tool for maintaining\u00a0\noperational stability. Switching to\u00a0\u00a0 hydrogen with only one third the volumetric\u00a0\nenergy density would reduce that line-pack\u00a0\u00a0 insurance to only a third of its current level.\nIn colder climates, where much more gas is needed\u00a0\u00a0 for heating in the winter, large volumes of\u00a0\nhydrogen would therefore have to be stored\u00a0\u00a0 somewhere else. Salt caverns are a possibility,\u00a0\nbut we haven\u2019t exactly got one of those on every\u00a0\u00a0 street corner, have we? And constructing\u00a0\nnew ones would be incredibly expensive.\u00a0 In order for the salt cavern to have any\u00a0\nstorage you have to have the pressure go\u00a0\u00a0 up and down which means all the pipes that\u00a0\ngo to and from it will have their pressure\u00a0\u00a0 going up and down. And the flow going\u00a0\nfirst one direction and then the other,\u00a0\u00a0 which makes all of this fatigue\u00a0\nbusiness even worse. So yeah, storage,\u00a0\u00a0 that salt cavern storage, and this notion of\u00a0\nseasonal storage is largely an economic myth.\u00a0 But let\u2019s assume all of those challenges were\u00a0\novercome. What about the appliances in our\u00a0\u00a0 homes? We\u2019ve all been reassured by the gas boiler\u00a0\nmanufacturers that all their new models will be\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018hydrogen ready\u2019, so that\u2019s encouraging\u2026right?\nYou have to replace the end use devices. It's\u00a0\u00a0 not a simple matter\u2026 listeners might be familiar\u00a0\nwith, for instance, buying an appliance that's\u00a0\u00a0 meant for natural gas, and then they switch\u00a0\nto LPG, you know, to propane or the like,\u00a0\u00a0 and all they have to do is replace a little nozzle\u00a0\nin the appliance, and it works fine. Again, well,\u00a0\u00a0 that's not the case with hydrogen, because\u00a0\nthe properties are completely different.\u00a0\u00a0 For one thing, hydrogen burns with a\u00a0\nflame that's not visible during the day.\u00a0 The rate at which a flame propagates. So,\u00a0\nwhen you ignite a gas mixture and the flame\u00a0\u00a0 moves along, it's eight times faster\u00a0\nfor hydrogen than it is for methane.\u00a0 So that causes problems with the buildup of\u00a0\npressure that happens if you happen to have a\u00a0\u00a0 release and then there's an ignition and you get\u00a0\nwhat they call a deflagration, a really fast fire\u00a0\u00a0 that doesn't generate a devastating supersonic\u00a0\nshockwave like an explosive would, but still, you\u00a0\u00a0 get a bad you know you release hydrogen in your\u00a0\nin your home, and then somebody turns on a light\u00a0\u00a0 switch and that ignites the hydrogen. That's way\u00a0\nworse than filling your, your room with methane,\u00a0\u00a0 even though the methane has a higher\u00a0\nenergy density per unit volume.\u00a0 There's a much wider range between the minimum\u00a0\nconcentration where you can start a fire called\u00a0\u00a0 the lower explosive limit and the maximum\u00a0\nconcentration where there's more fuel than\u00a0\u00a0 air and it can't ignite the upper explosive\u00a0\nlimit. The range between those two things for\u00a0\u00a0 hydrogen is the widest of basically any chemical.\nFor methane the range is between 5 and about 16\u00a0\u00a0 or 18 percent in air is ignitable and above 18\u00a0\nit's not and below 5 it's not, and with hydrogen\u00a0\u00a0 it's between 4 and 75 percent. So, it's a huge\u00a0\nrange. Basically, if you have a hydrogen leak, and\u00a0\u00a0 there's a source of ignition, which there always\u00a0\nis, you will have a deflagration and it'll be bad.\u00a0 Now, it\u2019s hardly surprising that\u00a0\nexisting gas network operators\u00a0\u00a0 are extremely keen for us to transition over\u00a0\nto hydrogen in our homes rather than simply\u00a0\u00a0 using electricity to run energy efficient\u00a0\ndevices like induction hobs and heat pumps.\u00a0 After all, they own an extremely\u00a0\nexpensive piece of infrastructure,\u00a0\u00a0 and they don\u2019t want to see it made redundant.\nBut, if I could offer my own two-penneth for a\u00a0\u00a0 moment, that view surely catastrophically\u00a0\nmisses the point, doesn\u2019t it? Surely the\u00a0\u00a0 objective here is to minimise greenhouse\u00a0\ngas emissions, not protect the profits of\u00a0\u00a0 industry incumbents who find themselves under\u00a0\nthreat from much better, more environmentally\u00a0\u00a0 friendly market disrupting alternatives.\nAnd so, you have to make some assumptions\u00a0\u00a0 about what hydrogen could cost in the future. So,\u00a0\nif we take the dreamy future where hydrogen, green\u00a0\u00a0 hydrogen made from electricity gets very, very\u00a0\ncheap and drops to three US dollars per kilogram.\u00a0 When you run the calculations is very much more\u00a0\nexpensive than three dollars And I think getting\u00a0\u00a0 to three dollars will be very challenging and\u00a0\nonly possible in certain parts of the world\u00a0 At three dollars a kilogram hydrogen used\u00a0\nto displace natural gas costs $350 per ton\u00a0\u00a0 of CO2 emissions averted. And at $350 per ton\u00a0\nof CO2 emissions averted, I can do all sorts\u00a0\u00a0 of things to eliminate CO2 emissions that are\u00a0\nfar more practical and sensible and quicker.\u00a0 And of course, the $3 a kilogram thing\u00a0\nis saying my cost of production is $3 a\u00a0\u00a0 kilogram and my cost of distribution is zero.\nYou have to pay a delivery charge because you\u00a0\u00a0 have to pay for those pipes and their\u00a0\nmaintenance and the compressors and\u00a0\u00a0 the energy to run them and all those things.\nI haven\u2019t included that. So, if you include\u00a0\u00a0 that, it's probably $700 a ton.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s really going on\u00a0\u00a0 here. It\u2019s a predatory delay strategy, it\u2019s\u00a0\nnot really about decarbonisation at all.\u00a0 We take energy for granted and greenhouse\u00a0\ngas emissions are something that happens\u00a0\u00a0 that we know is bad, but we generate\u00a0\nthem anyway and we kind of go about\u00a0\u00a0 our lives without thinking about it too much.\nAnd I get it. But at the same time, you know, the\u00a0\u00a0 public policy people that are thinking about this\u00a0\nstuff are not thinking about it carefully. And\u00a0\u00a0 they don't want to have the hard conversation with\u00a0\npeople and say, look, we're not going to let you.\u00a0 You want to build a new house? We're not going\u00a0\nto let you have a natural gas connection. Sorry.\u00a0 Why get you addicted to this thing that\u00a0\nwe're going to have to replace later? So\u00a0\u00a0 that's a logical first step that we should\u00a0\nbe taking. And we're already seeing howls of\u00a0\u00a0 protest where that's happening. And, you know,\u00a0\nit's understandable, but it's very unfortunate\u00a0\u00a0 and public policy in these matters.\nThat's why we wrote our paper. We\u00a0\u00a0 want people to make those decisions on\u00a0\nthe basis of good, sound, disinterested\u00a0\u00a0 scientific and and technical information.\nNo doubt you\u2019ve got your own views on this\u00a0\u00a0 hot topic, so as always, if you\u2019re\u00a0\nfeeling a burning desire to express\u00a0\u00a0 your opinion then jump down the comments\u00a0\nsection below to leave your thought there.\u00a0 That\u2019s it for this week though.

    "transcript": "Remember back in February we had a\u00a0\nlook at progress in the brave new\u00a0\u00a0 world of perovskite solar photovoltaic technology? You don\u2019t? Yeah, you do! We looked at the\u00a0\nUK firm Oxford PV and we discovered they\u00a0\u00a0 were well on the way to full production\u00a0\nof real, commercial scale solar panels\u00a0\u00a0 with an industry leading efficiency of\u00a0\ntwenty-eight-point-six percent, all as\u00a0\u00a0 a result of their pioneering work on\u00a0\noptimising perovskite\u2019s potential. Anyway, in the vanishingly unlikely\u00a0\nevent that you missed that episode,\u00a0\u00a0 you can click up there to\u00a0\njump back and have a look. The reason I mention it now, is because in early\u00a0\nSEPTEMBER twenty-twenty-four, Oxford PV began\u00a0\u00a0 shipping its first consignment of perovskite\u00a0\nPV modules to customers in the United States. That\u2019s very encouraging news in itself,\u00a0\nof course. But Oxford PV are not the only\u00a0\u00a0 organisation developing this apparently miraculous\u00a0\nmaterial. Anyone who gets it right is probably\u00a0\u00a0 looking at a bit of a goldmine quite frankly,\u00a0\nso laboratories all over the world are working\u00a0\u00a0 flat out to come up with the next breakthrough\u00a0\niteration. And now a team over in China reckons\u00a0\u00a0 they\u2019ve perfected a process that produces\u00a0\nverifiable perovskite solar PV cells that\u00a0\u00a0 have a conversion efficiency that\u2019s higher\u00a0\nthan the so-called Shockley-Queisser limit. What\u2019s the Shockley-Queisser limit? Why are solar\u00a0\nphotovoltaics constrained by it? Can the Chinese\u00a0\u00a0 team really be telling the truth? Why does it\u00a0\nmatter? What was that material called again? Yeah, I know. Let\u2019s take a look. Hello, and welcome to Just Have a Think. Before we get stuck in, I must just let you\u00a0\nknow about the upcoming Everything Electric\u00a0\u00a0 Live show in Farnborough in the south\u00a0\nof England this October. The Farnborough\u00a0\u00a0 International Exhibition and Conference Centre\u00a0\nis a massive venue with tons of outdoor space,\u00a0\u00a0 not just to display all the new private AND\u00a0\nCOMMERCIAL ELECTRIC vehicles that are now\u00a0\u00a0 flooding onto the market, but also to house\u00a0\nsome great attractions and safe areas for\u00a0\u00a0 the kids to run around and have some fun. Inside\u00a0\nthe conference centre you\u2019ll find all the major\u00a0\u00a0 suppliers of things like wall chargers, heat\u00a0\npumps, solar panels and battery energy storage\u00a0\u00a0 solutions with experts on hand to guide you\u00a0\nthrough the process of choosing the best system\u00a0\u00a0 for your home. I\u2019ll be hosting several live\u00a0\ndiscussion panels there across all three days,\u00a0\u00a0 so I\u2019ll be around to say hello if you decide\u00a0\nto come along. The whole thing kicks off on\u00a0\u00a0 Friday the eleventh of October and runs\u00a0\nthrough to Sunday the thirteenth. Tickets\u00a0\u00a0 are available now at the link on screen, and\u00a0\nin the description section below, and if you\u00a0\u00a0 use the exclusive Just Have a Think discount code\u00a0\nshown at the BOTTOM of the screen then you\u2019ll get\u00a0\u00a0 twenty percent off ALL tickets purchased. This one\u00a0\nis the biggest event in the Everything Electric\u00a0\u00a0 UK calendar folks, so I\u2019m really looking\u00a0\nforward to it and I hope to see you there! Right, back to today\u2019s topic, and\u00a0\nthat encouraging news from Oxford PV.\u00a0 They\u2019ve announced that their seventy-two-cell\u00a0\nsolar PV modules are now being shipped from their\u00a0\u00a0 new facility in Brandenburg an der Havel\u00a0\nin Germany to commercial customers over in\u00a0\u00a0 the States. BUT I noticed that they\u2019re\u00a0\nnow claiming a conversion efficiency\u00a0\u00a0 of twenty-four-point-five percent\u00a0\nfor the final production version.\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s significantly lower than the\u00a0\ntwenty-eight-point-six percent that\u00a0\u00a0 I mentioned earlier and that Oxford PV\u00a0\nthemselves still quote on their website. So why is that then? Well, it\u2019s because the website is quoting\u00a0\ncell efficiency while the shipped product\u00a0\u00a0 is a fully assembled panel. And that\u00a0\nmakes a difference. Individual cells\u00a0\u00a0 have a higher efficiency than full panels\u00a0\nsimply because lining them up, framing them,\u00a0\u00a0 and covering them with protective material\u00a0\nvery slightly reduces the cell efficiency. I\u2019m certainly not suggesting any\u00a0\nskullduggery here, by the way. Twenty-four-point-five percent is still\u00a0\nroughly twenty percent better than any\u00a0\u00a0 existing commercially available solar PV\u00a0\ntechnology, so it\u2019s not to be sniffed at.\u00a0 In a recent interview with the\u00a0\nfolks at PV Magazine, Oxford PV\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 Chief Exec, David Ward, said\n\u201cIt is a major breakthrough for\u00a0\u00a0 the energy industry that perovskite modules\u00a0\nare now economically viable. Highly efficient\u00a0\u00a0 technologies will dominate the future of the\u00a0\nsolar industry, and that future has begun.\u201d\u00a0 The company has suggested that technology like\u00a0\ntheirs, which combines perovskite material\u00a0\u00a0 with traditional silicon in a so-called tandem\u00a0\ncell has the potential to reach an efficiency\u00a0\u00a0 of forty-three percent. I\u2019ll come back to that\u00a0\nclaim a bit later in the video, but let\u2019s first\u00a0\u00a0 have a look at what this latest research\u00a0\npaper from the Chinese research team says.\u00a0 The team itself includes materials scientists\u00a0\nfrom the Institute of Photovoltaics at\u00a0\u00a0 Nanchung University, The Department of\u00a0\nApplied Physics at Hong Kong University,\u00a0\u00a0 The Wuhan University of Technology and the\u00a0\nInstitute of Optoelectronics at Fudan University.\u00a0 So, you know \u2013 quite specialised!\nThey reckon they\u2019ve come up with a\u00a0\u00a0 new organic coating that can increase the\u00a0\nefficiency of what are known as monolithic\u00a0\u00a0 tandem cells made of silicon and perovskite.\nAnd here\u2019s where we should probably pause for a\u00a0\u00a0 moment and talk about that whole Shockley-Queisser\u00a0\nthing that I mentioned at the start of the video,\u00a0\u00a0 and how TANDEM cells can theoretically\u00a0\novercome the limitations set out by that\u00a0\u00a0 law of physics. If you did watch my previous\u00a0\nperovskite video earlier in the year then\u00a0\u00a0 you\u2019ll already know this stuff, but it never\u00a0\nhurts to have a little reminder, does it?\u00a0 It\u2019s all to do with the way sunlight interacts\u00a0\nwith the materials in the solar cell. Or more\u00a0\u00a0 specifically, which wavelengths of light\u00a0\ninteract with those materials. Some atomic\u00a0\u00a0 semi-conductor structures can absorb a very\u00a0\nwide range of wavelengths, which is great\u00a0\u00a0 because that means you\u2019re using a large amount\u00a0\nof all the available sunlight. The trouble is,\u00a0\u00a0 those semi-conductors typically only\u00a0\ndeliver a very small electrical voltage,\u00a0\u00a0 which is no good in a solar panel. Other atomic\u00a0\nstructures can provide a much higher voltage but,\u00a0\u00a0 you guessed it, they typically only capture a\u00a0\nvery small range of wavelengths, which means most\u00a0\u00a0 of the energy in the sunlight is wasted.\nThe optimal trade-off was established in\u00a0\u00a0 nineteen-sixty-one by physicists William Shockley\u00a0\nand Hans Joachim Queisser. They found that SILICON\u00a0\u00a0 was the optimum available material, and that the\u00a0\nmaximum theoretical efficiency of a single layer\u00a0\u00a0 photovoltaic cell was around thirty percent.\nSo, how does perovskite fit into the mix\u00a0\u00a0 then? Well, the science bods tell us it\u2019s an\u00a0\ninorganic compound that can be produced very\u00a0\u00a0 precisely and inexpensively at low temperatures\u00a0\nin laboratories. It can be chemically manipulated,\u00a0\u00a0 or \u2018tuned\u2019 to capture different wavelengths of\u00a0\nlight to silicon. Over a decade ago, researchers\u00a0\u00a0 started applying thin layers of perovskite film\u00a0\non top of silicon wafers, and they found that by\u00a0\u00a0 doing that they could absorb a far wider spectrum\u00a0\nof light, maintain a good working voltage, and in\u00a0\u00a0 theory overcome that Shockley-Queisser limit of\u00a0\nthirty percent efficiency. That started a whole\u00a0\u00a0 field of tandem cell research that\u2019s still ongoing\u00a0\ntoday. One of perovskite\u2019s major challenges is\u00a0\u00a0 that is tends to degrade very quickly in sunlight,\u00a0\nso quite a lot of the last ten years has been all\u00a0\u00a0 about finding ways to make silicon-perovskite\u00a0\ncells reliable and stable enough to have a\u00a0\u00a0 decent working lifetime in the real world. And\u00a0\nthat has certainly been easier said than done!\u00a0 Oxford PV is leading the way, and the company\u00a0\nis working hard to produce production volume\u00a0\u00a0 panels that can genuinely convert more than\u00a0\nthirty percent of the sunlight received into\u00a0\u00a0 useful electrical energy. They\u2019re also convinced\u00a0\nthat it won\u2019t be too many more years before the\u00a0\u00a0 technology will reach the forty-three percent\u00a0\nefficiency I mentioned earlier \u2013 roughly double\u00a0\u00a0 the output of any solar panels you\u00a0\nmight have on your roof right now. So, this latest research over in China might just\u00a0\nturn out to be a useful addition to that work.\u00a0 So-called \u2018Monolithic\u2019 tandem cells\u00a0\nare made using a substrate of silicon\u00a0\u00a0 wafers that are produced by something called\u00a0\na zone melting process, and those wafers have\u00a0\u00a0 a highly polished or nanostructured surface.\nThere\u2019s also a cheaper alternative industrial\u00a0\u00a0 system, called the Czochralski process,\u00a0\nwhich produces silicon wafers with a tiny,\u00a0\u00a0 micrometre scale pyramid like which actually\u00a0\ncaptures more light as a result. The slight\u00a0\u00a0 wrinkle is that as soon as a second layer\u00a0\nof perovskite is applied to the sandwich,\u00a0\u00a0 it introduces a whole bunch of defects into\u00a0\nthe lattice, which messes up the ability of the\u00a0\u00a0 structure to convert light into free electrons.\nThe researchers on this paper have developed\u00a0\u00a0 a novel strategy for something called surface\u00a0\npassivation, which is a process that smoothes\u00a0\u00a0 out those defects and makes the perovskite\u00a0\nlayer much more effective at capturing the\u00a0\u00a0 relevant wavelengths of sunlight.\nThe Chinese team have come up with\u00a0\u00a0 an alternative that they describe as a\u00a0\n\u2018dynamic spray coating process\u2019 using a\u00a0\u00a0 typically unpronounceable chemical combination\u00a0\ncalled fluorinated thio-phenethylene-ammonium\u00a0\u00a0 with a trifluoromethyl group.\nWhich I finally got right\u00a0\u00a0 after only thirteen attempts!\nApparently, that combination has\u00a0\u00a0 high polarity and binding energy, which to you\u00a0\nand me means it squishes nicely into all the\u00a0\u00a0 tiny micrometre scale gaps and defects to smooth\u00a0\nout any lumps and bumps on the perovskite surface.\u00a0 When they applied the spray coated perovskite\u00a0\nto a standard textured wafer made using the\u00a0\u00a0 Czochralksi method I mentioned earlier,\u00a0\nthey achieved a conversion efficiency\u00a0\u00a0 of thirty-point-eight-nine percent, which they\u2018ve\u00a0\napparently had certified by independent assessors.\u00a0 And the good news is - it looks, unlike\u00a0\nsome other lab-based initiatives that\u00a0\u00a0 we\u2019ve featured on the channel over the years,\u00a0\nthis one might just stand a chance of actually\u00a0\u00a0 being useful in the real world.\nTests showed that devices\u00a0\u00a0 fitted with these passivated cells\u00a0\ndisplayed excellent operational stability,\u00a0\u00a0 retaining over ninety-seven percent\u00a0\nof their initial performance after\u00a0\u00a0 six hundred hours of continuous illumination.\nThe full science of how it all works at molecular\u00a0\u00a0 level is set out in intricate detail in the\u00a0\npaper, and is frankly well over my head.\u00a0 The paper itself is, I\u2019m afraid, only accessible\u00a0\nthrough a paywall, so I can\u2019t share the copy that\u00a0\u00a0 I purchased, but I have left a link in the\u00a0\ndescription section below to the summary page\u00a0\u00a0 in case you\u2019re keen to find out more.\nSo, one more incremental step towards\u00a0\u00a0 ever-improving solar PV efficiency, or just\u00a0\nmore lab-based hopium? I\u2019m optimistic this\u00a0\u00a0 one might turn out to be the former and not\u00a0\nthe latter, but I guess only time will tell!\u00a0 Feel free to leave your thoughts\u00a0\non the subject in the comments\u00a0\u00a0 section below, but that\u2019s it for this week.\nThanks, as always to the amazing folks who support\u00a0\u00a0 my work via Patreon, and I must just give a quick\u00a0\nshout out to some folks who joined recently with\u00a0\u00a0 pledges of ten dollars or more a month, They are\nNiels Herkild, Steve Durnal, Jay McIntosh,\u00a0\u00a0 Tim Ski, Chris Wood, Robert Beck, Bob Covey,\u00a0\nEric Biggers, Stephan Miller, Werner Theinert,\u00a0\u00a0 Joe Mastey, Shab Kumar, Stuart Gulvin,\u00a0\nRichard Holden, Matt V. and Mike Crompton\u00a0 If you\u2019d like to join them and discover the\u00a0\nexclusive perks you enjoy at my Patreon page,\u00a0\u00a0 then jump over to Patreon dot com forward slash\u00a0\njust have a think.

    "transcript": "Right now, over in the People\u2019s Republic of\u00a0\nChina, a company called Minyang Smart Energy\u00a0\u00a0 is busy installing what it claims to be the\u00a0\nworld\u2019s largest floating wind turbine \u2013 with\u00a0\u00a0 a V-shaped design able to support not one,\u00a0\nbut two turbines on each platform, giving a\u00a0\u00a0 total generating capacity of seventeen megawatts.\nMeanwhile, over in the United States of America,\u00a0\u00a0 GE already operates the two-hundred\u00a0\nand sixty metre tall, fifteen megawatt,\u00a0\u00a0 Haliade X offshore wind turbine, and is developing\u00a0\nits own floating version to go further out to sea.\u00a0 European turbine producers Siemens Gamesa\u00a0\nand Vestas have also developed giant offshore\u00a0\u00a0 turbines with capacities around fifteen\u00a0\nmegawatts, hundreds of which are in use in\u00a0\u00a0 the world\u2019s largest wind farms at Dogger\u00a0\nBank off the Northeast Coast of England.\u00a0 And the new UK labour government has just reversed\u00a0\na de facto ban on the installation of ONSHORE wind\u00a0\u00a0 farms, paving the way for thousands of new\u00a0\nturbines over the course of the next decade.\u00a0 This is all good stuff for the so-called green\u00a0\ntransition of course, and wind power is rapidly\u00a0\u00a0 becoming a major component of electricity grids\u00a0\nin many parts of the world. There is one major\u00a0\u00a0 wrinkle though. All these behemoth machines have\u00a0\na slightly concerning characteristic in common,\u00a0\u00a0 which is that their gargantuan blades,\u00a0\nsome reaching 230 metres in length,\u00a0\u00a0 are almost impossible to recycle. And that means,\u00a0\nas first-generation turbines are starting to reach\u00a0\u00a0 the end of the operational life, those enormous\u00a0\ncomponents are simply being chopped up and tossed\u00a0\u00a0 straight into landfill sites all over the planet.\nAnd that is very definitely NOT what we signed\u00a0\u00a0 up for when we all collectively\u00a0\ndecided to start giving a damn\u00a0\u00a0 about the climate and environment is it?\nThere have been some minor improvements\u00a0\u00a0 in recycling techniques, to be fair, and shredded\u00a0\nblade chippings can now be used in industries like\u00a0\u00a0 road building for example. But what if the entire\u00a0\nindustry has been focussing on finding a solution\u00a0\u00a0 for the wrong problem? That\u2019s what a team at the\u00a0\nUS National Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL.\u00a0\u00a0 asked themselves. Instead of trying to find ever\u00a0\nmore complicated ways to recycle existing blades,\u00a0\u00a0 how about making the blades out of something\u00a0\ncompletely different in the first place, they\u00a0\u00a0 said \u2013 something that can be easily broke down\u00a0\ninto fully organic components that can be re-used.\u00a0\u00a0 Better still, something entirely plant-based?\nWhat a ridiculous idea I hear you cry.\u00a0 Well, they\u2019ve only gone and on\u00a0\ndone it anyway, haven\u2019t they? Hello and welcome to Just Have a Think,\nBefore we get stuck in, I must just let you\u00a0\u00a0 know about the upcoming Everything Electric Live\u00a0\nshow in Farnborough in the south of England this\u00a0\u00a0 October. The Farnborough International Exhibition\u00a0\nand Conference Centre is a massive venue with tons\u00a0\u00a0 of outdoor space, not just to display all the\u00a0\nnew private AND COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC vehicles\u00a0\u00a0 that are now flooding onto the market, but\u00a0\nalso to house some great attractions and\u00a0\u00a0 safe areas for the kids to run around and have\u00a0\nsome fun. Inside the conference centre you\u2019ll\u00a0\u00a0 find all the major suppliers of things like wall\u00a0\nchargers, heat pumps, solar panels and battery\u00a0\u00a0 energy storage solutions with experts on hand to\u00a0\nguide you through the process of choosing the best\u00a0\u00a0 system for your home. I\u2019ll be hosting several live\u00a0\ndiscussion panels there across all three days,\u00a0\u00a0 so I\u2019ll be around to say hello if you decide\u00a0\nto come along. The whole thing kicks off on\u00a0\u00a0 Friday the eleventh of October and runs through\u00a0\nto Sunday the thirteenth. Tickets are available\u00a0\u00a0 now at the link on screen, and in the description\u00a0\nsection below, and if you use the exclusive Just\u00a0\u00a0 Have a Think discount code shown at the BOTTOM of\u00a0\nthe screen then you\u2019ll get twenty percent off ALL\u00a0\u00a0 tickets purchased. This one is the biggest event\u00a0\nin the Everything Electric UK calendar folks,\u00a0\u00a0 so I\u2019m really looking forward to\u00a0\nit and I hope to see you there!\u00a0 Right, where were we? Turbine blades.\nYou probably know the scoop with these things\u00a0\u00a0 already, but it\u2019s worth a quick recap anyway.\nYour typical wind turbine is essentially\u00a0\u00a0 composed of a tower, a nacelle, which is the\u00a0\nthing at the top that houses the gearbox and\u00a0\u00a0 the generator and all the other mechanical\u00a0\ngubbins, and then the rotor blades themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the turbine components comprise\u00a0\nstuff like steel, copper, and electronics,\u00a0\u00a0 all of which can be easily recycled using well\u00a0\nestablished and relatively inexpensive technology.\u00a0 But the blades are a nightmare. They have to\u00a0\nbe light-weight and durable and capable of\u00a0\u00a0 withstanding the stresses and strains of rotating\u00a0\nat speeds of more than two hundred miles an hour\u00a0\u00a0 at the tips, in conditions ranging from completely\u00a0\nbenign all the way up to gale force nine. Until\u00a0\u00a0 recently, the best way to achieve that was to use\u00a0\ncomposite materials like fiberglass-reinforced\u00a0\u00a0 plastic and carbon fibre, all intricately\u00a0\nintertwined and gunked together with high\u00a0\u00a0 strength resins specifically designed to prevent\u00a0\nthe blades ever disintegrating. It\u2019s something\u00a0\u00a0 the science bods describe as a \u2018permanently\u00a0\ncross-linked thermoset\u2019. That\u2019s fantastic\u00a0\u00a0 while the blades are in service, but absolutely\u00a0\nhorrendous when you come to dispose of them. None\u00a0\u00a0 of it is biodegradable, so they\u2019re not going to\u00a0\nbreak down in those landfill sites. They\u2019re just\u00a0\u00a0 going to sit there, slowly leaching out their\u00a0\ntoxic chemicals for decades or even centuries.\u00a0 According to this research paper, if we keep\u00a0\nmaking these things in the way we do today\u00a0\u00a0 then by mid-century we will have discarded\u00a0\nsomething like forty-three million tonnes\u00a0\u00a0 of turbine blades. Energy-intensive recycling\u00a0\nprocesses like pyrolysis and solvolysis use\u00a0\u00a0 high temperatures or chemical solvents to\u00a0\nbreak down composite materials, and they\u00a0\u00a0 produce secondary waste streams that typically\u00a0\nrequire further treatment before final disposal.\u00a0 Some so-called recycling\u00a0\nmethods like incineration,\u00a0\u00a0 release harmful chemicals and toxic fumes from\u00a0\nthe resins and other materials used in blade\u00a0\u00a0 construction, all of which poses an additional\u00a0\nenvironmental challenge. And at the end of all\u00a0\u00a0 that, unlike the steel and copper and electronics\u00a0\nfrom other parts of the turbine that can be\u00a0\u00a0 easily re-used, blade recycling just produces\u00a0\nshredded fiberglass, carbon fibre and resin,\u00a0\u00a0 that often have very limited reuse potential.\u00a0\nThat means there\u2019s a lack of demand and therefore\u00a0\u00a0 a lack of revenue for anyone looking to recycle\u00a0\nblades for a profit. So, in most cases, the course\u00a0\u00a0 of least resistance, at least right now anyway,\u00a0\nis the dreaded landfill that I mentioned earlier.\u00a0\u00a0 Anyone who can find a workable solution to that\u00a0\nconundrum is therefore likely to become quite\u00a0\u00a0 popular with the world\u2019s turbine manufacturing\u00a0\ncommunity as well as environmentalists concerned\u00a0\u00a0 about the impacts of blade disposal.\nAnd I imagine that was a big part of\u00a0\u00a0 the motivation for the team at NREL.\u00a0\nTheir research paper, published in\u00a0\u00a0 August twenty-twenty-four in the online journal\u00a0\nScience, outlines a method for the production\u00a0\u00a0 of what they describe as \u2018biomass-derivable\u00a0\nthermosets\u2019, or to give the full science-speak\u00a0\u00a0 description \u2013 \u2018biomass-derivable\u00a0\npolyester covalent adaptable network\u00a0\u00a0 fibre reinforced composites\u2019, or PECAN FRCs.\nTo normal folks like you and me that means\u00a0\u00a0 a material made from a combination of, plant\u00a0\nremains, discarded used cooking oil, agricultural\u00a0\u00a0 waste, and sugars extracted from wood.\nSounds like a bit of a hotch-potch,\u00a0\u00a0 doesn\u2019t it? So how have the NREL folks managed\u00a0\nto get it to look and work like a turbine blade?\u00a0 Well, the researchers first explained that\u00a0\nexisting turbine blade resins are typically\u00a0\u00a0 cured in bulk at about eighty degrees Celsius\u00a0\nfor five hours. The industry standard material,\u00a0\u00a0 called RIMR-135 goes through a second\u00a0\nheating step at between a hundred and\u00a0\u00a0 twenty and a hundred and eighty degrees for\u00a0\nanother two hours, which of course is very\u00a0\u00a0 energy hungry, and adds a time-consuming\u00a0\nextra step to the manufacturing process.\u00a0 So, the NREL team experimented with several\u00a0\ndifferent versions of their PECAN composite,\u00a0\u00a0 each with different proportions of the\u00a0\nbiomass components I mentioned earlier,\u00a0\u00a0 to see if they could produce something that could\u00a0\nbe processed using the same 5-hour, eighty-degree\u00a0\u00a0 Celsius curing procedure but without the need\u00a0\nfor the secondary higher temperature step.\u00a0 The detailed science of that work is set\u00a0\nout in the paper and is a bit outside the\u00a0\u00a0 scope of this video to be honest, but\u00a0\nthe results were extremely encouraging.\u00a0 The best version of their alternative\u00a0\nmaterial, which they called Pecan FIFTEEN,\u00a0\u00a0 was demonstrated to be a direct drop-in\u00a0\nreplacement for traditional blade materials that\u00a0\u00a0 can be used in the same enormous, warehouse\u00a0\nsized moulds using the same manufacturing\u00a0\u00a0 techniques in existing production facilities\u00a0\nwith no adaptations necessary, which of course,\u00a0\u00a0 is an essential priority for industry adoption.\nThe NREL team built a ten-metre prototype blade\u00a0\u00a0 and conducted tests designed to simulate twenty\u00a0\nyears\u2019 worth of exposure to the elements. At the\u00a0\u00a0 end of all that they were able to demonstrate\u00a0\na PECAN FRC with similar or in some cases even\u00a0\u00a0 superior performance to existing materials\u00a0\nin terms of creep, weathering resistance,\u00a0\u00a0 and thermomechanical performance.\nBut the big question is,\u00a0\u00a0 can it be easily recycled?\nWell, once again there\u2019s some\u00a0\u00a0 pretty complicated scientific commentary going on\u00a0\nin the paper itself, but in terms that I can get\u00a0\u00a0 my head around, the team put their PECAN FRC\u00a0\ninto a bath of methanol and heated it up to\u00a0\u00a0 two hundred and thirty degrees Celsius for about\u00a0\nsix hours. Now that\u2019s still a pretty energy hungry\u00a0\u00a0 process of course, but at the end of it they got\u00a0\nout a sort of elastic liquid that they found could\u00a0\u00a0 be fully remoulded into a new shape.\nPossibly not for new turbine blades,\u00a0\u00a0 because there may be issues with strength\u00a0\nand durability with multiple recycling,\u00a0\u00a0 but certainly for all sorts of different durable\u00a0\nproducts currently produced by other methods. And\u00a0\u00a0 that is very definitely not something that\u00a0\ncan be done with existing blade materials.\u00a0 According to this separate research\u00a0\npaper, multiple life-cycle assessments\u00a0\u00a0 have demonstrated that the second life of a\u00a0\nso-called \u2018recyclable-by-design polymer\u2019 such\u00a0\u00a0 as PECAN fifteen can result in thirty to more than\u00a0\nninety percent in material cost and greenhouse gas\u00a0\u00a0 emissions for the second life of the material.\nAnd even greater economies of scale will most\u00a0\u00a0 likely kick in, just like they do with all new\u00a0\nmarket disruptors, and surely the more forward\u00a0\u00a0 thinking, rational turbine manufacturers will be\u00a0\nable to see the obvious practical, environmental\u00a0\u00a0 and frankly public relations benefits of producing\u00a0\nmore easily recyclable and re-useable hardware.\u00a0 So, you know, with continued innovation and\u00a0\ninvestment, probably backed up by some central\u00a0\u00a0 government subsidy in the short term, we could\u00a0\nhave a genuine solution to the turbine blade\u00a0\u00a0 recycling conundrum here. And that has to be\u00a0\nan encouraging development, don\u2019t you think?\u00a0 Well, what do you think? Leave your thoughts on\u00a0\nthe subject in the comments section below, and\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019ll be keen to see what the consensus look like.\nThat\u2019s it for this week though. Thanks, as always\u00a0\u00a0 to the folks who support the channel via Patreon.\u00a0\nI don\u2019t monetise my videos on YouTube or take\u00a0\u00a0 paid sponsorships, so this channel literally\u00a0\nwould not exist without that amazing group\u00a0\u00a0 of like-minded souls in all four corners of\u00a0\nthe globe supporting the work I do each week.\u00a0\u00a0 If you\u2019d like to join them and discover the\u00a0\nexclusive perks you enjoy at my Patreon page,\u00a0\u00a0 then jump over to Patreon dot com forward slash\u00a0\njust have a think.

    "transcript": "Economies all over the world are growing, because\u00a0\nof course that\u2019s what economists tell us economies\u00a0\u00a0 are supposed to do in a capitalist system, isn\u2019t\u00a0\nit? What those economists don\u2019t worry much about\u00a0\u00a0 though is the side effects of that growth -\u00a0\nsomething they rather dismissively refer to\u00a0\u00a0 as \u2018externalities\u2019. Externalities occur when the\u00a0\nactivities of individuals or businesses impose\u00a0\u00a0 non-financial costs that are not accounted for\u00a0\nin the market transaction. Typical examples are\u00a0\u00a0 things like air pollution from factories and\u00a0\ngreenhouse gas emissions from the combustion\u00a0\u00a0 of fossil fuels. So, as western nations get\u00a0\never richer and developing nations continue\u00a0\u00a0 to pull hundreds of millions of people out of\u00a0\nabject poverty, the obvious implication is that\u00a0\u00a0 energy consumption will increase and so will\u00a0\nthe pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that\u00a0\u00a0 inevitably come as a result of that consumption.\nBut is it inevitable though? Or are we simply\u00a0\u00a0 basing our assumptions on an old, out of date\u00a0\nand hopelessly inefficient system? That\u2019s a\u00a0\u00a0 question being posed by an increasing number\u00a0\nof companies who are using tools like AI and\u00a0\u00a0 other technologies to completely re-imagine the\u00a0\nfundamentals of supply and demand in our energy\u00a0\u00a0 systems. They tell us that the greenest electron\u00a0\nis the electron that doesn\u2019t get used at all,\u00a0\u00a0 and they reckon they\u2019ve cracked the code\u00a0\nfor moving us all in that direction. Hello, and welcome to Just Have a Think. Talking of green electrons, I must just let\u00a0\nyou know about the upcoming Everything Electric\u00a0\u00a0 Live show in Farnborough in the south\u00a0\nof England this October.

This one is the biggest event\u00a0\nin the Everything Electric UK calendar folks,\u00a0\u00a0 so I\u2019m really looking forward to\u00a0\nit and I hope to see you there! Right, back to today\u2019s business then.\nThanks to much more advanced scientific\u00a0\u00a0 data collection tools, alongside sustained\u00a0\npressure from environmental groups,\u00a0\u00a0 the spotlight of responsibility for tackling\u00a0\nour climate emergency has started to shift\u00a0\u00a0 firmly towards CORPORATE greenhouse gas\u00a0\nemissions nowadays. There\u2019s a growing\u00a0\u00a0 ECONOMIC imperative to do better as\u00a0\nwell. Here in Europe, for example,\u00a0\u00a0 many countries have suffered a sustained\u00a0\nperiod of high energy prices following\u00a0\u00a0 Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, highlighting an\u00a0\nunsustainable reliance on Russian gas and oil.\u00a0 The answer that we all hear about in the news\u00a0\nthese days is to accelerate the move away\u00a0\u00a0 the transition will all but remove the roughly\u00a0\n60 to 70 percent of completely wasted efficiency\u00a0\u00a0 that comes as a result of attempting to generate\u00a0\nenergy for work via heat from combustion. That\u00a0\u00a0 means we don\u2019t have to replace the amount of\u00a0\nPRIMARY energy produced by coal, gas and oil.\u00a0\u00a0 We just have to replace this bit over here at\u00a0\nthe consumer end of the so-called Sankey chart.\u00a0 But as global demand for energy grows, renewables,\u00a0\ndespite the astonishing progress of recent years,\u00a0\u00a0 are still not keeping up with that demand.\nSo, essentially, if we want to get anywhere\u00a0\u00a0 near our net zero goals, the industry experts\u00a0\nare telling us that we will need to do more\u00a0\u00a0 with less. That way, the two lines on\u00a0\nthe graph start to come together and we\u00a0\u00a0 really start to unlock the full potential\u00a0\nof solar, wind and battery energy storage.\u00a0 A huge part of that is energy efficiency.\u00a0\nAccording to an early analysis by the World\u00a0\u00a0 Resources institute, state energy efficiency\u00a0\nprograms in the US over the last decade or so\u00a0\u00a0 may have saved consumers between two and\u00a0\nfive dollars for every dollar invested.\u00a0 The International Energy Agency, or IEA,\u00a0\ntells us that a collective push for energy\u00a0\u00a0 efficiency could deliver more than a third\u00a0\nof the total emissions reductions needed to\u00a0\u00a0 reach net zero by twenty-fifty. By that\u00a0\ntime, according to the United Nations,\u00a0\u00a0 more than two thirds of all the humans on\u00a0\nthe planet will live in urban environments.\u00a0 The World Economic Forum points out\u00a0\nthat buildings are responsible for\u00a0\u00a0 nearly forty percent of global greenhouse gas\u00a0\nemissions, so one of the biggest opportunities\u00a0\u00a0 available to us is to radically reform the way\u00a0\nthose buildings are heated, cooled and lit. And that\u2019s where artificial intelligence\u00a0\nand the so-called Internet of Things,\u00a0\u00a0 or IOT come into play, especially in places like\u00a0\nlarge corporate office blocks. Companies like\u00a0\u00a0 75F and in the US and BrainBox AI in Canada\u00a0\nhave developed control systems that optimize\u00a0\u00a0 building energy management using networks of\u00a0\nsmart sensors, cloud computing, and machine\u00a0\u00a0 learning algorithms. Those systems continuously\u00a0\nmonitor real-time data like temperature, humidity,\u00a0\u00a0 occupancy, and air quality throughout a\u00a0\nbuilding, as well as external influences\u00a0\u00a0 like weather patterns. All that data is then\u00a0\ntransmitted to a controller in a cloud server,\u00a0\u00a0 where clever algorithms crunch all the numbers and\u00a0\nsend appropriate messages back to adjust heating,\u00a0\u00a0 ventilation, and air conditioning settings\u00a0\nautomatically, thus optimizing indoor conditions\u00a0\u00a0 for energy efficiency. Their systems also learn\u00a0\nfrom building usage patterns to make predictive\u00a0\u00a0 adjustments ahead of time. All of that results in\u00a0\nsignificant reductions in energy consumption, and\u00a0\u00a0 a much more comfortable workplace for the folks in\u00a0\nthe building, which helps improve therefore their\u00a0\u00a0 performance levels. And of course, the operational\u00a0\ncosts for building owners are much lower too.\u00a0 Others, like Clockwork Analytics in Boston,\u00a0\nMassachusetts, and Gridium in California,\u00a0\u00a0 have developed data-driven systems that focus\u00a0\non optimizing building performance through\u00a0\u00a0 continuous commissioning and fault detection.\u00a0\nFacility managers receive actionable insights and\u00a0\u00a0 recommendations through a user-friendly interface,\u00a0\nenabling them to take targeted corrective actions\u00a0\u00a0 that improve operational efficiency, reduce\u00a0\nenergy consumption, and lower maintenance costs. And then there\u2019s Audette, based in Vancouver,\u00a0\nCanada, who use advanced integrated software\u00a0\u00a0 to conduct energy audits in large corporate\u00a0\nbuildings. Machine learning helps to model\u00a0\u00a0 energy consumption and benchmark buildings against\u00a0\nindustry standards. That then generates detailed,\u00a0\u00a0 actionable reports highlighting potential\u00a0\nretrofits, upgrades, and operational improvements. It\u2019s not all about commercial buildings though,\u00a0\nis it? In twenty-twenty-one the UN estimated\u00a0\u00a0 that there were something like two-point-three\u00a0\nbillion domestic households globally. And as I\u2019m\u00a0\u00a0 sure you\u2019re only too aware, those are some of the\u00a0\nleakiest and most inefficient buildings we humans\u00a0\u00a0 currently inhabit. The IEA tells that heating and\u00a0\ncooling in domestic households accounts for nearly\u00a0\u00a0 fifty percent of their overall energy consumption.\u00a0\nImproving insulation and the air tightness of what\u00a0\u00a0 the industry bods call the building envelope is\u00a0\nof course a highly effective strategy for reducing\u00a0\u00a0 the amount of energy that escapes, and modern\u00a0\nenergy-efficient windows, especially double- or\u00a0\u00a0 triple-glazed windows, can reduce energy use\u00a0\nby a further twenty percent. Even the way we\u00a0\u00a0 light up our homes can make a big difference.\u00a0\nWe all know about LED technology of course,\u00a0\u00a0 but beyond that there are companies\u00a0\nlike Lumen Cache over in the States,\u00a0\u00a0 who utilise data cables instead of standard\u00a0\nelectrical wires to create household lighting\u00a0\u00a0 and device control systems. In fact, from a single\u00a0\ncontrol box, the Lumen Cache system can cover\u00a0\u00a0 ninety percent of fixtures and appliances in the\u00a0\nhome, reducing copper wires by sixty percent, and\u00a0\u00a0 offering a thirty percent saving by using low\u00a0\nvoltage DC power that can seamlessly integrate\u00a0\u00a0 with rooftop solar without the need for the\u00a0\ninefficient conversion from DC to AC that our\u00a0\u00a0 traditional domestic electrical systems require.\nArtificial Intelligence is now creeping into our\u00a0\u00a0 domestic homes as well, in a very similar way\u00a0\nto the commercial systems we\u2019ve just looked at.\u00a0\u00a0 According to the IEA, our domestic appliances\u00a0\naccount for around fifteen to twenty percent of\u00a0\u00a0 household energy use, but as we move to smart\u00a0\nmeters and smart devices, all controlled by\u00a0\u00a0 servers on that internet of things or IOT that\u00a0\nI mentioned earlier, our homes are starting to\u00a0\u00a0 become an integrated element of the electricity\u00a0\ngrid, in some cases even helping to ensure grid\u00a0\u00a0 stability throughout the day. Water heating for\u00a0\nexample accounts for around fourteen percent of\u00a0\u00a0 a typical household\u2019s energy consumption, and\u00a0\ncompanies like Mixergy, here in the UK, have\u00a0\u00a0 developed products like the Mixergy smart water\u00a0\ntank, that not only heats water up in an entirely\u00a0\u00a0 different and much more efficient way than a\u00a0\ntraditional immersion heater, but also has the\u00a0\u00a0 capability to communicate with a cloud controller\u00a0\nto automatically switch on at a time of day when\u00a0\u00a0 electricity supply is cheap and plentiful.\u00a0\nThat means savings for the consumer, but it\u00a0\u00a0 also potentially means better, more efficient\u00a0\nuse of renewables like wind turbines that might\u00a0\u00a0 otherwise have to be switched off, or curtailed,\u00a0\nwith all the costs and inefficiencies that that\u00a0\u00a0 involves. Same thing with electric vehicles.\u00a0\nI visited the head office of the UK\u2019s largest\u00a0\u00a0 electricity supplier, Octopus Energy, recently and\u00a0\nhad a chat with their CEO, Greg Jackson about how,\u00a0\u00a0 among myriad other brilliant initiatives,\u00a0\nthey\u2019re also revolutionising the EV sector.\u00a0 \u201cUsing electric car batteries is an incredible way\u00a0\nof balancing the grid, [\u2026] because today Octopus\u00a0\u00a0 alone has one-point-zero-six-six gigawatts, so\u00a0\nover a gigawatt, of electric vehicles that we\u00a0\u00a0 charge with a bespoke schedule for each vehicle\u00a0\nevery day, designed to do this exact job of\u00a0\u00a0 balancing the grid. It allows us to grab the\u00a0\ncheapest electricity, often when it\u2019s windy or\u00a0\u00a0 sunny or when the grid\u2019s underutilised and charge\u00a0\nthe cars at those times. That gives us\u2026the drivers\u00a0\u00a0 on these products can do a hundred miles for\u00a0\n\u00a32.40. That\u2019s seven times cheaper than petrol\u00a0\u00a0 or diesel. But they\u2019re also helping to bring\u00a0\ndown the cost of electricity for everyone else,\u00a0\u00a0 because they\u2019re helping balance the grid and\u00a0\nsoaking up this cheap electricity when it\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 abundant, using less when it\u2019s in tight supply,\u00a0\nwhich that for everyone else that\u2019s using it at\u00a0\u00a0 those times, there\u2019s less demand.\u201d\n\u201cBut the scale is quite remarkable.\u00a0\u00a0 I mentioned earlier that we\u2019ve got about a\u00a0\ngigawatt of smart charged electric cars. [\u2026]\u00a0 And we\u2019ve only got a market share of about\u00a0\ntwenty-odd percent in the UK. And not all\u00a0\u00a0 cars have got the capability yet to do the smart\u00a0\ncharging. So, if you multiply that up, you know,\u00a0\u00a0 if you went from 5% of cars to 100% of cars,\u00a0\ninstead of being one gigawatt, that would be\u00a0\u00a0 20. If it wasn\u2019t just Octopus \u2013 if it was across\u00a0\nall companies \u2013 you might get another four times\u00a0\u00a0 that. You could be looking at the best part\u00a0\nof a hundred gigawatts of shiftable power.\u201d\u00a0 So, it\u2019s all moving at breakneck speed right now,\u00a0\nand it can all seem a bit bewildering at times,\u00a0\u00a0 but there\u2019s no doubt that big corporations\u00a0\nhave well and truly cottoned on to the\u00a0\u00a0 economic advantages of improving energy\u00a0\nefficiency, and of course, they\u2019re all\u00a0\u00a0 very happy to get brownie points for ostensibly\u00a0\ndoing something for the climate as well, even if\u00a0\u00a0 that\u2019s not really their main motivation. And they\u00a0\ncan achieve that goal much more easily now thanks\u00a0\u00a0 to incredibly innovative tech companies like the\u00a0\nones we\u2019ve featured today, and many others all\u00a0\u00a0 over the world. We still have huge challenges\u00a0\nin all sorts of other sectors like land use,\u00a0\u00a0 industry, aviation and shipping for example,\u00a0\nbut all of those sectors are being disrupted\u00a0\u00a0 as well by innovators who are finally upending\u00a0\nthe old- fashioned, monopolistic, centralised\u00a0\u00a0 energy supply systems that were tailored to the\u00a0\nneeds of the fossil fuel industry, and which\u00a0\u00a0 are now starting to look hopelessly outdated.\nFeel free to leave your thoughts on the subject\u00a0\u00a0 in the comments section below, but that\u2019s it for\u00a0\nthis week.

    "transcript": "If you\u2019ve been a reasonably regular viewer of this\u00a0\nchannel over the last few years you will no doubt\u00a0\u00a0 have listened to me banging on about Arctic Sea\u00a0\nice on several occasions. It\u2019s a subject that the\u00a0\u00a0 mainstream media wasn\u2019t at all interested in\u00a0\nwhen I first started making videos about the\u00a0\u00a0 climate emergency back in twenty seventeen.\nBut then, when those media outlets realised\u00a0\u00a0 it made for nice dramatic headlines and lots\u00a0\nof clicks, it suddenly became a hot topic,\u00a0\u00a0 to the extent that by now most folks probably\u00a0\nfeel like they\u2019ve heard it all a million times\u00a0\u00a0 before and, you know, let\u2019s move on to the\u00a0\nnext exciting news headline as if Arctic\u00a0\u00a0 Sea ice loss was a single event that happened\u00a0\nonce and doesn\u2019t require any further attention.\u00a0 That\u2019s not a view shared by climate scientists\u00a0\nthough. They do think it requires further\u00a0\u00a0 attention. And the more attention they give it\u00a0\nthe more concerned, or to put it another way,\u00a0\u00a0 terrified, they appear to become.\nIn its Sixth Climate Assessment report,\u00a0\u00a0 published in twenty-twenty-one, the\u00a0\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate\u00a0\u00a0 Change projected that as long as\u00a0\nwe kept greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0\u00a0 in reasonable check there would be a low risk\u00a0\nof regular ice-free Summer Arctic Seas until\u00a0\u00a0 the last couple of decades of this century.\nBut the trouble with those pesky scientists\u00a0\u00a0 is they keep doing more research and coming\u00a0\nup with more accurate data and demonstrable,\u00a0\u00a0 empirical evidence. A research paper full\u00a0\nof just such research was published in\u00a0\u00a0 twenty-twenty-three and it found that whatever\u00a0\nwe do now, we are almost certainly heading\u00a0\u00a0 for regular ice-free Summer Arctic Seas\u00a0\nwell within the next couple of decades.\u00a0 So, I thought we\u2019d better have\u00a0\na bit of a think about that. Hello and welcome to Just Have a Think\nEvery September, at the end of the Northern\u00a0\u00a0 hemisphere summer, the surface area of the ice\u00a0\npack covering the Arctic Sea reaches its lowest\u00a0\u00a0 point. It\u2019s a pretty decent swing from maximum\u00a0\nto minimum as well, as this animation shows.\u00a0 That\u2019s all a perfectly normal part of the\u00a0\nseasonal ebbs and flows that keep our planets\u00a0\u00a0 ecosystems regulated and allow life to flourish.\u00a0\nThe thing is though, as we all know only too well,\u00a0\u00a0 greenhouse gas emissions have been accelerating\u00a0\nsince the industrial revolution and that warming\u00a0\u00a0 has been reducing the amount of ice cover all\u00a0\nover the place, including in the Arctic Sea. In nineteen fifty the world emitted six billion\u00a0\ntonnes of carbon dioxide. By nineteen-ninety it\u00a0\u00a0 was more than twenty billion tonnes,\u00a0\nand today it\u2019s around forty billion. Ice is white so it reflects sunlight as a result\u00a0\nof what the scientists call \u2018high albedo\u2019. The sea\u00a0\u00a0 is dark, so it has very low albedo and it\u2019s very\u00a0\ngood at absorbing sunlight. That means as sea ice\u00a0\u00a0 surface area reduces, more sunlight gets absorbed\u00a0\ninto the water, heating it up and melting even\u00a0\u00a0 more ice, which means less reflection of sunlight\u00a0\nand more absorption of heat and so on and so on in\u00a0\u00a0 a self-reinforcing feedback loop. That\u2019s one of\u00a0\nthe main reasons why the Arctic is warming three\u00a0\u00a0 to four times faster than the rest of the planet,\u00a0\nand in some regions more like seven times faster. Which brings us neatly to the recent research\u00a0\npaper, written by a team of authors from a\u00a0\u00a0 variety of institutions including Pohang\u00a0\nUniversity in South Korea, the Canadian\u00a0\u00a0 Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, and the\u00a0\nInstitute of Oceanography at Hamburg University. What they wanted to know is whether the\u00a0\nmethodology set out in the IPCC Sixth Assessment\u00a0\u00a0 Report was robust enough to accurately predict\u00a0\nthe rate of sea ice decline up in the Arctic. The IPCC uses what they call Shared Socioeconomic\u00a0\nPathways or SSPs to provide projections based on\u00a0\u00a0 how our global society might behave in the\u00a0\ncoming decades. There are five SSPs ranging\u00a0\u00a0 from \u201cKumbaya\u201d to \u201cKiss your ass goodbye\u201d. Based\u00a0\non real-world satellite observations of changes in\u00a0\u00a0 the Arctic since nineteen-seventy-nine, fed into\u00a0\nan enormous climate modelling program called the\u00a0\u00a0 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6\u00a0\nor CMIP6 for short, the IPPC concluded that,\u00a0\u00a0 as long as we restrict ourselves\u00a0\nto the less severe scenarios,\u00a0\u00a0 then we can expect a good level of Arctic Sea ice\u00a0\ncover for more or less the rest of this century,\u00a0\u00a0 in theory buying us plenty of time to sort\u00a0\nourselves out, radically reduce our emissions,\u00a0\u00a0 slow down the warming and avert\u00a0\nthe worst consequences altogether. The main challenge posed by this latest\u00a0\npaper is to the measuring methodology itself. The total surface area of the Arctic Ocean\u00a0\nis about fourteen million square kilometres.\u00a0\u00a0 A so-called \u2018ICE-FREE\u2019 Arctic is defined\u00a0\nas occurring when ice surface area drops\u00a0\u00a0 below one million square kilometres. The\u00a0\nconventionally accepted measure of ice in\u00a0\u00a0 the Arctic Sea is known as \u2018Sea Ice Extent\u2019.\u00a0\nThe ocean is divided up into a grid and then\u00a0\u00a0 each square in that grid is considered in\u00a0\nisolation. If a square contains at least\u00a0\u00a0 a fifteen percent sea ice concentration,\u00a0\nthen it counts as being covered in ice. The wonderful scientific understatement\u00a0\nused by this paper\u2019s authors to describe\u00a0\u00a0 that methodology was that it\u00a0\nwas \u2018strongly grid dependent\u2019. You and I might use slightly more direct\u00a0\nlanguage, like \u2018totally bonkers\u2019, but for the\u00a0\u00a0 purposes of this video I\u2019ll stick to the science\u00a0\nand try my best to avoid over-dramatic hyperbole. These researchers followed a different path. They\u00a0\u00a0 used a measure of sea ice area defined\u00a0\nas the ACTUAL area covered with sea ice,\u00a0\u00a0 which they claim to be \u2018more appropriate\u00a0\nfor comparison with satellite observations\u00a0\u00a0 than sea ice extent, having a smaller\u00a0\nobserved uncertainty than sea ice extent\u2019. They applied that method to three\u00a0\nsatellite observation data sets taken\u00a0\u00a0 from nineteen-seventy-nine to twenty-nineteen and\u00a0\nthen overlaid their measurements onto the same\u00a0\u00a0 shared socioeconomic pathways that the IPCC uses.\nThe results indicated that we won\u2019t have to wait\u00a0\u00a0 until twenty-eighty to see the first ice free\u00a0\nSummer Arctic. In fact, it\u2019s highly likely\u00a0\u00a0 to occur as early as the twenty-thirties\u00a0\nand almost certainly before mid-century,\u00a0\u00a0 EVEN if we stay on the very lowest shared\u00a0\nsocio-economic pathway, which of course we\u2019re\u00a0\u00a0 nowhere near achieving at the moment.\nSo, why does that matter then?\u00a0 Well, Arctic Sea ice plays a crucial role in the\u00a0\u00a0 Earth's climate system. It influences global\u00a0\nweather patterns, supports diverse ecosystems,\u00a0\u00a0 regulates temperatures, and serves as a\u00a0\nvital component of indigenous cultures. We\u2019ve already touched on the most\u00a0\nobvious benefit of ice cover,\u00a0\u00a0 which is to reflect sunlight back up into space\u00a0\nto help keep our planet at a safe temperature. Beyond that though, the formation of sea ice\u00a0\ncontributes to the process of thermohaline\u00a0\u00a0 circulation, which drives the movement of ocean\u00a0\ncurrents around the globe. As sea ice forms,\u00a0\u00a0 it expels salt into the surrounding water,\u00a0\nincreasing the salinity and density of the\u00a0\u00a0 water. That dense water sinks, helping to\u00a0\ndrive the global conveyor belt of ocean\u00a0\u00a0 currents that regulate temperatures and\u00a0\ndistribute nutrients around the world. A rapidly warming Arctic has also altered\u00a0\nwind patterns, which among other things has\u00a0\u00a0 led to the EXPORT of sea ice FROM the central\u00a0\nArctic TO the North Atlantic, where it melts.\u00a0\u00a0 More melted ice in THAT region means less salty,\u00a0\nor fresher, water, which means less sinking,\u00a0\u00a0 and a slowing down of systems like the Atlantic\u00a0\nMeridional Overturning Circulation or AMOC,\u00a0\u00a0 which is a key DRIVER of the global thermohaline\u00a0\ncirculation. And just to really exacerbate the\u00a0\u00a0 situation, as all our global oceans warm,\u00a0\nscientists are seeing a greater influx of\u00a0\u00a0 those warm waters FROM lower latitudes up into the\u00a0\narctic region, further accelerating sea ice loss.\u00a0\u00a0 And by the way, it's not just declining surface\u00a0\narea that has the scientists worried. Arctic\u00a0\u00a0 Sea ice is also becoming thinner and younger\u00a0\ntoo, which means it\u2019s much more vulnerable to\u00a0\u00a0 extreme weather events breaking up the pack\u00a0\nand acerating the melt in any given season. Global ocean temperatures in twenty-twenty-three\u00a0\nand twenty-twenty-four have been so far above any\u00a0\u00a0 previously recorded levels that even when a\u00a0\nstrong El Nino effect is taken into account,\u00a0\u00a0 oceanographers and climate scientists are unable\u00a0\nto explain the additional heat being measured\u00a0\u00a0 all the way from the surface right down to depths\u00a0\nof two thousand metres. Their real concern is\u00a0\u00a0 that those vast volumes of water, which have\u00a0\nuntil now absorbed more than fifty percent of\u00a0\u00a0 all human induced CO2 emissions and more than\u00a0\nninety percent of the consequent extra heat,\u00a0\u00a0 may have finally reached their limit and could now\u00a0\nbe starting to release that energy back into our\u00a0\u00a0 atmosphere. Which would be bad. It\u2019s a phenomenon\u00a0\nthat was very bluntly and graphically explained\u00a0\u00a0 by climate expert Johan Rockstr\u00f6m during a recent\u00a0\nTed talk, which you can watch by clicking the link\u00a0\u00a0 at the top of the screen. And I\u2019ll leave a link\u00a0\nto that video in the description section as well. It\u2019s not just the ocean circulatory system\u00a0\neither, by the way. The Arctic acts as a\u00a0\u00a0 cold cap on the planet, and as it warms, it\u2019s\u00a0\ndisrupting the northern hemisphere jet stream,\u00a0\u00a0 causing more frequent and severe weather\u00a0\nevents like heatwaves, extreme cold snaps,\u00a0\u00a0 and more violent storms in North America,\u00a0\nEurope, and Asia. Losing such a large\u00a0\u00a0 expanse of sea ice also warms the air over\u00a0\nGreenland, causing an acceleration in the\u00a0\u00a0 melting of the Greenland ice sheet which in\u00a0\nturn contributes to the rising sea levels\u00a0\u00a0 that are already threatening coastal communities\u00a0\nworldwide with increased flooding and erosion. Then there\u2019s the release of methane from thawing\u00a0\npermafrost. Methane is a greenhouse gas about\u00a0\u00a0 eighty times more potent than carbon dioxide over\u00a0\nthe roughly twelve years or so that it exists in\u00a0\u00a0 the atmosphere before being broken down into\u00a0\ncarbon dioxide and water. There\u2019s thought to\u00a0\u00a0 be about fifteen-hundred-billion tonnes of methane\u00a0\nlocked up in permafrost across the entire arctic\u00a0\u00a0 circle, so even if only a tiny fraction of\u00a0\nthat was to escape in a short timescale,\u00a0\u00a0 the additional, currently unaccounted for,\u00a0\nwarming effect would be very significant indeed. All of this stuff is catastrophic\u00a0\nin itself, but if you\u2019re a modern\u00a0\u00a0 market-driven capitalist and you just\u00a0\nwant the cold hard numbers, then how\u00a0\u00a0 about this. According to the latest estimates\u00a0\nhighlighted by Rockstr\u00f6m in his TED talk,\u00a0\u00a0 our current path will result in an eighteen\u00a0\npercent loss in global GDP by twenty-fifty.\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s a cost to you and me and everyone else on\u00a0\nthe planet of thirty-eight trillion dollars every\u00a0\u00a0 single year. And that WILL hurt! Even\u00a0\nhere in our cosy rich western economies. So, what does the Arctic Sea Ice minimum\u00a0\nlook like in September twenty-twenty-four? Well, it\u2019s not quite as low as twenty-twelve when\u00a0\na freak weather system called the Great Arctic\u00a0\u00a0 Cyclone smashed up the already thin and fragile\u00a0\nice pack, leading to unusually accelerated levels\u00a0\u00a0 of melting. But it\u2019s not far off, and neither was\u00a0\ntwenty-twenty-three. And all of the last few years\u00a0\u00a0 are clearly well below the nineteen-eighty-one\u00a0\nto twenty-ten median, shown here in grey. According to Johan Rockstrom, there is at least a\u00a0\nfaint glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel,\u00a0\u00a0 although I have to say it\u2019s far from likely that\u00a0\nwe\u2019ll reach it. During his TED talk he tells us\u00a0\u00a0 that if we wanted to stay within the safe zone\u00a0\nof only one-point five degrees of warming then\u00a0\u00a0 we will only be able to emit another two-hundred\u00a0\nbillion tonnes of carbon dioxide in total. That\u00a0\u00a0 might sound like a lot but given the fact that\u00a0\nwe currently churn out forty billion tonnes of\u00a0\u00a0 the stuff every year, that means we\u2019ve only got\u00a0\nfive years to reduce those emission to zero.\u00a0\u00a0 On our current trajectory and based on much\u00a0\nmore up to date and accurate modelling done\u00a0\u00a0 by ever more powerful computers, Rockstrom\u00a0\nsays we will sail past two degrees Celsius\u00a0\u00a0 above pre-industrial levels within twenty\u00a0\nyears, and three degrees by the end of the\u00a0\u00a0 century \u2013 temperatures that this planet has not\u00a0\nexperienced for more than three million years,\u00a0\u00a0 and that the human species has never\u00a0\nexperienced in its entire existence. Now you might accuse me of presenting exactly the\u00a0\nsame sensationalist click bait material here that\u00a0\u00a0 I accused the mainstream media of at the start of\u00a0\nthis video. But I can assure you that salacious\u00a0\u00a0 headlines and maximising clicks has never been\u00a0\nthe motivating factor for the Just Have a Think\u00a0\u00a0 channel. I present unsettling information like\u00a0\nthis from time to time not to send everyone into\u00a0\u00a0 a doom loop of defeatism but to galvanise all\u00a0\nof us into much more positive and affirmative\u00a0\u00a0 action in order to bring about the changes\u00a0\nwe so desperately need as quickly as humanly\u00a0\u00a0 possible. I\u2019ll leave it to you to consider what\u00a0\nthose changes might look like in your own life,\u00a0\u00a0 and I\u2019ll be very interested to hear your\u00a0\nviews in the comments section below. I\u00a0\u00a0 would strongly recommend watching Rockstr\u00f6m\u2019s\u00a0\nTED talk video though. It\u2019s a real eye opener. Anyway, that\u2019s it for this week.

    "transcript": "Many people have rigid ideas about wildlife and wild spaces. They expect that wild animals\nshould stay away from cities. But  the reality is far from this. And even in a crowded city like Mumbai. Nature  has found its way. Our city is surrounded by an ecosystem like no other. A place where the changing tides control the life around it. and perhaps a place which is an unparalleled example of urban wildlife. Mangroves As a kid I remember we were taught in school that mangrove is like a superhero tree. It is a tree\nwhere no other tree could survive. They support a lot of biodiversity. The dense root system of mangroves helps the fishes for spawning. A lot of birds come and nest\naround the mangroves. But what we were\nspecifically interested in, were the mammals. The golden jackal. Almost for a decade now, I've been working in Mumbai,\nunderstanding, studying the urban biodiversity. Mumbai is blessed to have a mix of two habitats, the sea and the mountains, the city supports a lot of wildlife. So we had a prior information that there are jackals\nin Mumbai's mangroves. But then, there was no comprehensive study on, this jackal population So with this objective in mind, we, collaborated with WCS-India. And finding jackals in the mangroves might not be as easy as you think. Everything was dependent on the tide. We couldn't go just after the tide had gone down, then it could be very mucky and our legs would go deep in the mud.  This landscape is practically a maze, where the routes\nkeep altering with the changing tides. If the team had to solve this puzzle, they would have to learn\nfrom someone who knows who knows this landscape. It is not very easy to go out and spot them. We wanted to understand where these jackals are, how are they distributed? To do that, we used camera traps. Camera traps helped us be at places, when we actually weren\u2019t there. The team deployed camera traps at over 68 locations. What makes this even more interesting is that the camera traps were not set  only in the heart of the mangroves, but also along the periphery where the human activity was dominant. However, when the tides came in, not all camera traps survived. We lost a lot of camera traps.  Some of them also got stolen. But the worst was we not being prepared for the tides. Over the span of six months, the team deployed camera traps \nthroughout the mangroves of Mumbai. And the results caught everyone\nby surprise. There were species like grey mongoose, small Indian civets  and even jungle cats\nthat were captured on camera traps. And then there was the apex predator of Mumbai mangroves. the golden jackal. However, there were some signs of concern. Even deep inside the mangroves. there were records of free ranging dogs. There were quite a few incedences where we saw  domestic dogs chasing golden jackals. They were using similar trails. Marking territories at the same spot. We also wanted to look at the interactions which were taking place between jackals and humans. How are the jackals\nsurviving in this urban landscape with so much pressure? The answer was right in front of our eyes. We looked at the time. And we clearly observed that the jackals were highly nocturnal. with peaks between dawn and dusk. So, in order to survive in this landscape \nwhere there were lot of people, one simple thing jackals did was avoided them during the day. We found that\nthere are at least five packs with pups at different age classes, We could observe some which were newly born. some pack which had a little grown up pups. Among the chaos of people, urban encroachment and competition\nwith dogs The presence\nof breeding population of jackals in these mangroves is a sign that they are not just surviving, but flourishing in Mumbai. And there's more to this story. There was one particular image which really shocked us all. Because we had photographed a leopard walking in the mangroves. I had never imagined making a photohraph where a leopard is walking through pneumatophores. So golden jackals, leopards are just the flag bearers  of this entire cohort of species\nwhich live around humans They are very well adapted to maneuver around these spaces\nand survive in these ever challenging landscapes. I think it's high time we acknowledge the existence of urban biodiversity."

    "transcript": "climate change's Devastation is hitting us today from extreme weather to Rising seas and if we want to stop this Devastation we have to stop the world from heating which means we have to stop burning fossil fuels so how do we stop burning fossil fuels well now new research is revealing what we're doing that's already working and what we could do to build Unstoppable momentum towards our carbon free future I'm Adam a climate scientist with a PhD from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change and today I want to talk about how we stop climate change in this video I don't want to discuss the end goal stopping emitting or the technical steps getting rid of fossil fuels and building up clean energy because honestly I've spoken about both these topics loads already I want to focus on how we can actually get ourselves get our societies to take these steps now I hate to be the bearer of bad news but we are not on track the world is emitting billions of tons more greenhouse gases than it should be and we're heading for an overwhelming 3\u00b0 Celsius by the end of this Century that would smash through our heating limits keeping warming to under two or ideally just 1.5\u00b0 C and the more we heat the planet the more homes are in inundated by Rising Seas the more lives are lost to devastating disasters and the more people struggling to get enough water or enough food so back to that question how do we stop climate change and two Studies have just come out to help us answered one looks at what's actually worked in the past and another has reflected on what could build Unstoppable momentum in the future so let's look back to the past first now this paper looked at over 1,5 500 policy measures across the past 20 years covering countries in six continents so they couldn't be bothered to analyze anarctica this seems unusually late to introduce the quizzical character well better late than never which is kind of the climate action catchphrase let's get back to the study let's the researchers wanted to know which of the 1,500 policies actually lowered emissions but surely analyzing 1,500 individual policies would take forever isn't there a way they could get a machine to learn to do it instead so the researchers used machine learning to do it okay that figures using this artificial intelligence technique they could look for cases where emissions actually dipped then the researchers could work back from these dips and find the policies that caused them and the first result is that there were actually cases when emissions dipped really because it feels like we're making zero progress towards net zero yeah well I definitely get this feeling because we for sure are not making enough progress but we are for sure making progress in fact another study recently showed that high CO2 emission scenarios are thankfully now impossible because of progress in climate Tech and economics okay so great some climate policies have actually worked to cut emissions but which well out of the 1,500 policy adoptions the study found large emissions reductions in 6 9 cases don't say it seriously don't say it because there's nothing nice about the fact that there were just 69 cases leading to large emissions reductions okay yeah that isn't great but why did these policies succeed where hundreds of others fail well the study found that combinations of policies are much more effective than Standalone policies which makes sense right we humans often need multiple motivators when we want to change our Habits Like quitting smoking by reminding yourself how much cigarettes suck but also by giving yourself little treats to congratulate yourself on kicking the habit and that's what we see in a lot of these climate policy combinations so Norway managed to lower transport emissions by Banning combustion engines and actively making electric cars cheaper so reminding drivers that fossil fuels suck and giving a little treat for clean Alternatives but wait Norway is Banning combustion engine cars that would never work in my country funny you should say that because the study also found that what works in one country might not work in another take the power sector in richer countries policies that make dirty energy harder to make and sell are best at lowering emissions but in poorer countries making clean energy cheaper with subsidies was most successful okay so this study showed that some policies worked and others didn't but how is that helpful it's helpful because now countries can make sure they Implement policies that will actually work and that could help us get emissions cuts on track but there's another crucial part of the equation for getting us on the right Future Path Society you mean like us right and the other study is all about us and the Tipping elements that could help save the day oh I've heard of tipping elements oh wait aren't they really bad well yeah in climate science we often talk about tipping elements or tipping points these are points of no return where we push the climate so far that it suddenly tips into a different state and can't be brought back at least not easily for example the vast ocean circulation in the Atlantic could switch off or the Amazon rainforest could lose its ability to function as a rainforest okay so how on Earth could that help save the day well what if there weren't just tipping points for the planet but also for us people what if we could build up enough momentum for social dynamics that those tipped starting an Unstoppable irreversible path towards a cleaner future I'm guessing those questions are kind of the point of the study yeah which it answered by surveying over 100 experts the study looked at what we could do the interventions that could achieve these tipping elements the researchers called the social tipping interventions or STI wait STI yep I guess they didn't survey that 100 experts on whether phrases like STI in the education system could be open to misinterpretation apparently not okay well let's get stuck into the STI then please don't say that good call let's start by looking at the Energy System even though Renewables are now the cheapest form of energy ever there's still a bunch of financial hurdles actually making the energy transition so shifting subsidies away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy and creating power grids for decentralized power generation could push us towards the Renewables Tipping Point then there's the question of the financial system our financial system still invests hugely in fossil fuels those things that we need to leave in the ground and not burn if we're not going to overheat the planet y those things the divestment movement can help tip the financial system everyone from individuals to institutions could stop investing in fossil fuels potentially then reinvesting in projects that benefit society and the environment and to get our society on the right path we can start to shift our norms and values so people seeing fossil fuels and climate change as a moral issue right like the fact that fossil fuels Hammer the most vulnerable with pollution and extreme weather while raking in profits for the richest leaders taking a moral stand on fossil fuels could shift society's values especially spiritual leaders like Pope Francis but why do Society could also push towards this social Tipping Point like young activists who see our Energy System for what it is and demand change then there's the most important Tipping Point of all education is it actually the most important or are you just saying that because you focused your whole career on climate education please stick to the script fine please tell me more about the Fantastic role of Education I'd love to education has a crucial role in Social Transformations and climate change is no exception but most climate education is patchy at best we can build this up so we as a society understand the causes impacts and solutions to climate change change and I mean really understand so we can see our place in this how climate change harms Us and how we can be a part of the solutions and that's exactly what this channel is all about I make these videos without product placements or monetization because I don't want to sell you all rubbish that you don't need and honestly that's quite hard because apparently not selling things isn't exactly the best business model which is why I'm incredibly grateful to my amazing team of patrons who make all of this possible you can join them up here but if that's not for you all you climates who like comment and subscribe you're pretty amazing too so thank you you're welcome but this is the crucial takeaway from this research we can all help we can all push towards these social tipping points whether it's by supporting Community energy moving our money away from fossil fuels protesting for more Just Energy System or yeah helping spread reliable climate information like from climate scientists with phds from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change okay sure I'm posting now and it's not just that our individual action can help tip us to a climate friendlier Society it's also that these actions feed back on each other like better education can help shift our values which would make it easier to remove fossil fuel subsidies and Investments which helps cities to decarbonize I'm liking these kinds of tipping points and feedbacks when we think about climate change it's easy to feel disheartened after all climate change is this huge structural problem which requires huge structural Solutions it can feel like nothing is being done and that we individuals are powerless to do anything but these studies show that that's just not true countries are passing policies that are starting to bend our emissions curve and we can all push Society towards the Tipping points we need to Halt the heating and the truth is that halting the heating has never been more urgent like coral reefs the more we understand them the more we understand how vital they are for us and how vulnerable they are to the heating with throwing at them and here's why okay until next time byee it might be time for a haircut when I'm inhaling my hair"

importance to the Natural and human worlds so what would a world without coral reefs look like and can we save the world's reefs I'm Adam a climate scientist with a PhD from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change and you really need to know about coral reefs this video isn't sponsored I don't want to sell you all stuff you don't need so no sponsorships no monetization if you're into that you can join my incredible patrons up here or just liking subscribing and commenting helps massively too now growing up in the UK pretty far from the nearest Tropical coral reefs I had the feeling that coral reefs were just these beautiful magical far off places and I mean they are but there's so much more than that too they are crucial for wildlife even though they cover less than 1% of the ocean surface they support over a quarter of all marine life and like with anything that's vitally important for the planet that means they're vitally important for people too you know because people live on the planet half a billion people across the globe depend on coral reefs for everything from food to financial income and because reefs break up strong waves they protect low-lying land from storms which is getting more and more important as climate change raises our seas and makes storms more powerful and maybe you don't care about any of this because you don't live anywhere near Coral Reef and you haven't discovered empathy well then you should know that by supporting the world's oceans coal reefs are also supporting the world's food system and economy so here comes the depressing bit these vital ecosystems are in serious danger you might have already heard of coral bleaching where beautiful vibrant reefs are transformed into these colorless wastelands to understand bleaching you need to understand that reefs are made up of tiny animals called Coral polyps and these live in harmony with algae that live inside their tissues and give corals their color by the way those visuals are from a film I made for the channel Planet a all about saving coral reefs link below low if temperatures sore the algae can freak out and the pop ends up kicking them out leaving the coral looking white and lifeless and that's what bleaching is bleached Coral isn't dead yet but lots of bleaching can end up fatal for polyps and lots of bleaching is exactly what's been happening the last year he seen reefs around the globe suffering from extreme ocean heat let's look at the Great Barrier Reef this is one of the seven natural wonders of the the world and Earth's largest coral reef system literally visible from space and yes the research for this video did include Googling fun facts about the Great Barrier Reef well here's a less fun fact about the Great Barrier Reef it suffered through five mass bleaching events in just 8 years including the one we've just seen and these are affecting huge suedes of the reef this year bleaching was recorded on 34s of the reefs that make up the entire system now you might have read the news that the Great Barrier Reef had made an incredible recovery over the last couple of years and don't get me wrong this is definitely good news but there is a limit to its goodness the recovery has largely been down to faster growing Coral species coming in which can also be very vulnerable when temperatures Spike again over the last year we've seen just how fragile this recovery can be when Rising temperatures stalled the growth in fact it can take decades for a reef to fully recover after severe Mass bleaching and as we heat the Seas more and more these events will start to take place so often that the Great Barrier Reef simply doesn't have time to recover the more we learn the more we realize just how extreme today's conditions are for coral and that's where a new study comes in to find out how the extreme heat of today compares to what Corals in the Great Barrier Reef are used to the researchers asked the corals I mean they obviously didn't literally ask the corals that would be ridiculous but I phrased it that way because it sounded more poetic what they actually did is look directly at the temperatures the corals themselves have experienced to do this they studied the skeletons of Boulder corals which can live for hundreds of years and form structures over 8 m tall bands in the skeleton like rings in a tree trunk revealed how hot the water has been over the past four centuries and over all this time the hottest temperatures were the five bleaching events that happened in the last 8 years on top of that the average temperature now is significantly hotter than it has been for the past 400 years by the way that doesn't mean that it was hotter 500 years ago than now it just means this record only stretches back 400 years and look this result is super important but it isn't exactly super surprising we already knew that average temperatures on Earth are now likely higher than they've been for over 100,000 years but investigating this on the local scale and really checking and seeing what corals themselves are adapted to well it really confirms that they are not adapted to the temperatures we're throwing at them today and it's not just boiling temperatures that we're throwing at them the carbon dioxide we're emitting is dissolving in the oceans and making Waters more acidic human activities are driving outbreaks of coral killing starfish harmful fishing practices are hammering reefs we're dumping all sorts of pollution into the Seas from sunscreen to plastic and when it comes to the Great Barrier Reef adding insult to injury Australia allows the shipping of fossil fuels across this world heritage area actually considering how damaging this could be to the reefs should really say adding injury to injury getting to grits with these threats really is a matter of life and death for the world's Coral us climate scientists compare different future worlds for example if the world Heats by 1.5 versus 2\u00b0 C so this normally gives results like at 1.5\u00b0 one in 17 insect species will lose most of their habitat but at 2\u00b0 that'll be one in six insect species so 1.5\u00b0 of global warming is bad for insects 2\u00b0 is worse but for coal reefs it's not bad and worse it's bad and game over at 1.5\u00b0 of global warming we're looking at 70 to 90% losses of coral reefs at 2\u00b0 we're looking at over 99% of reefs lost that's what the intergovernmental panel on climate change found in 2018 and Recent research backs it up one paper looked at the regions of reefs that keep relatively cool when temperatures spike it found that when glob global warming reaches 1.5\u00b0 these would make up just 0.2% of global coral reef cover when we pass 2\u00b0 they wouldn't exist at all and it's important to point out that we're already dangerously close to the 1.5\u00b0 Limit and current projections indicate we could heat the World by 3\u00b0 by the end of this Century so these results mean there is a very real risk of the world losing these beautiful unique precious ecosystems within my lifetime okay so coal reefs are kind of screwed but fortunately there's lots of things we can do to unscrew them the most obvious and urgent things are remove all the harms that we can remove easily for example creating Marine protected areas protecting reefs from Shipping pollution and over fishing then there's all the stuff we could do to help corals adapt to more inhospitable conditions for example bringing in the toughest corals to the coolest regions of reefs helping entire reefs shift to cooler areas and even working in the lab to create heat resistant super corals all of this can help and all of this is being researched but none of this is a substitute for the real fix stopping climate change as long as we're pumping out greenhouse gases we're raising temperatures and acidifying the ocean given how incredibly vulnerable reefs are we need to stop climate change as quickly as possible and use every other solution we can get our hands on and personally I really do hope to live long enough to learn how we saved these incredible underwater environments and not to see how we lose them now as I was talking about 1.5\u00b0 of global warming you might have thought of headlines like this and thought haven't we already passed 1.5\u00b0 and the answer is actually no and here's why okay in till next time bye God I'm genuinely like bleaching as I record this because it is very warm"

    "transcript": "later this year the United States will vote for its 47th president and from an assassination attempt to last minute candidate changes the race to the White House has made headlines before it's even fully begun Behind These headlines are two candidates kamla Harris and Donald Trump so when it comes to climate change what's actually the difference between these two candidates and what could the next president of the United States mean for the entire world I'm Adam a climate scientist with a PhD from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change and today I want to talk about the climate credentials of the next president of the United States I want to talk about this because what happens in the USA doesn't stay in the USA the US is the biggest historic emitter causing more climate change than any other nation and the US hugely influences what the world does to Halt global warming the past year has been an absolute scorcher and we're already feeling the devastation that climate change causes from extreme weather to the spread of disease and the tough truth is it's already incredibly late to limit warming to relatively safe levels at this point every single decision matters for how livable our future will be so let's talk about the decision that America is facing at the time I'm recording this is between Republican former president Donald Trump and the presumptive nominee of the democratic party current vice president kamla Harris now I know what you Americans are probably thinking who's a Brit like you to tell us Americans who to vote for and to that I would say two things firstly I hope you all appreciate the restraint it took to not do an American accent for that character and secondly my biggest audience is actually in the US and worldwide people are talking about Harris and Trump I've seen some people working on climate arguing that the two candidates are somehow equivalent and others going full Brat mode in their support for Harris so the point of this video is not to tell people who to vote for I just feel like it's important that people know the differences between the two candidates and that definitely includes the differences when it comes to climate change and that's really the first thing to spell out the two candidates are actually different really different let's look at their words first Donald Trump has repeatedly denied basic climate science saying things like it'll start getting cooler you just watch and arguing climate action harms Americans leav in American workers and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs lower wages shuttered factories quick note but Trump often argues that he opposes clean energy because he cares about jobs but clean energy jobs already hugely outnumber fossil fuel jobs in America okay but onto kamla Harris this is how she talks about climate change climate change has become a climate crisis and she's argued that when we invest in climate we create jobs we lower costs and we invest in families okay so great Harris says she believes that climate change is serious while Donald Trump denies the fundamentals but actions speak louder than words and that's one thing that's great about this presidential race we can actually look at the candidates actions what they've actually done when they've been in office one of the very first things that Donald Trump did was announced the US would exit the Paris climate agreement so we're getting out now slightly hilariously this only came into effect one day after the 2020 US presidential election which Trump lost to Joe Biden who then immediately rejoined the Paris climate agreement but even so the departure of the world's biggest historic emitter stalled Global action and upended negotiations in fact I was at the 2018 climate negotiations and Trump's climate in action was the backdrop to well to everything that was being discussed and Trump didn't just change the US's role on the international stage from approving major oil pipelines to Rolling back over 100 environmental rules Donald Trump has weakened emissions limits and reversed efficiency standards he also had a major impact on the courts appointing judges with anti-environment track records including Supreme Court Justices this led to the Supreme Court ruling restricting how the Environmental Protection Agency can control CO2 emissions after all this Trump still claims that I had the best environmental numbers ever which is misleading at best the improvements that were seen would generally cause by things like covid shutdowns pre-existing regulations and general Trends away from coal in other words some environmental measures improved despite Trump not because of him but it's hardly surprising that the man who has repeatedly called climate change a hoax isn't exactly a climate Champion the question is is kamla Harris actually any better well let's look at what's actually happened over the last four years while Harris served as vice president to Joe Biden most importantly they in UC the inflation reduction act often referred to as the IRA much to the confusion of British people like myself Harris cast the tiebreaking vote to pass the IRA which pushes hundreds of billions of dollars towards reducing emissions with subsidies for everything from solar panels to electric cars and this is a big deal for the climate in fact it's often held as the biggest deal for the climate in US history in terms of numbers the Environmental Protection Agency estimates it means reducing emissions by at least a third by 2030 relative to 205 levels and in terms of my personal experience I can genuinely say that many of the climate nerds that I know never thought we'd see such ambitious climate change policy from the US regardless of political party and speaking of shining endorsements I feel a sponsor message coming on well you feel incorrectly I don't want to sell you all things with my videos and so no monetization no product placements videos like this are entirely supported by my amazing patrons join them up here or if that's not for you just liking and subscribing are pretty good too can we get back to kamla Harris's record now sure we can look further back than just her time as VP as California District Attorney she set up an environmental justice unit to prosecute environmental crimes in California and that was almost two decades ago in 2005 and later as attorney general she secured multi million settlements on environmental violations from car companies and oil firms she even sued none other than the Obama Administration in an effort to Halt new offshore fracking permits and looking to the Future what her presidency might bring her climate adviser has said she would focus on implementing the inflation reduction act and it's worth pointing out that when she ran for Democratic Presidential nominee in 2019 her climate platform was way more ambitious than Biden's calling for everything from a carbon tax to a ban on fracking for oil and gas on public lands so it could be that should' be even more of a climate Champion than her predecessor if she becomes president in 2025 and while we're looking at what could happen in 2025 we have to talk about project 20 2 project 2025 is a 900 page far right blueprint by the Heritage Foundation for the next conservative presidency and it covers a lot of extremely concerning ground from potentially criminalizing people who provide abortions to eliminating the Department of Education seriously if you haven't heard of it definitely look into it some links for further reading as always are provided below Trump has tried to distance himself from it even claiming he knows nothing about it but this doesn't exactly check out half the blueprint authors worked under him during his presidency and he's mentioned in it hundreds of times and he previously said the Heritage Foundation would detail plans for what he would do in his next presidency but I digress here's what the project could actually mean for the climate it proposes scrapping what it calls climate alarmism but is actually vital Research into the threat climate change poses and the solutions we could take on top of that it would increase fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and halt the National Weather Services role as forecaster which would halt their life-saving extreme weather warnings on everything from tornadoes to heat waves and when it comes to pollution that directly harms the health of humans and the environment project 2025 takes a firm stand on the side of polluters emphasizing costs to Industry over environmental win-wins all in all this would mean a crisis for combating the climate crisis and there's good reason to think it's exactly what Trump is planning now don't get me wrong kamla Harris has overseen harmful climate policies too the Biden Harris Administration has for example given the green light to the willow project drilling oil in the Alaskan Arctic and fossil fuels are still receiving tax breaks plus the US is still not doing its fair share to limit global warming to 2\u00b0 let alone 1.5\u00b0 C these are the limits that would keep our planet relatively safe from the worst consequences of climate change so I guess this is the point where you make the lesser of two evils argument actually honestly no because when it comes to climate change we're still looking at a choice between a candidate who'd be who has been devastating for the climate and one who has overseen some of the most ambitious acts to protect our environment that the US has ever seen just to be clear the first one is Trump and the second one is Harris the truth is that we have seen big steps forward from Harris and that certainly contrasts with the giant leaps back that Trump has implemented in the past and hopes for in the future I thought you said you weren't going to tell us who to vote for and I'm not the goal of this video is to point out that when it comes to climate there are huge differences between these two potential presidents what you do with that information is obviously your call and of course there are many other factors that go into Who You'd vote for or whether you'd feel comfortable to vote at all from Reproductive Rights to the US economy to healthc care to the US's continued bipartisan support for Israel killing tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians but I will say this climate change can make us feel powerless but we're not every time we raise our voices on climate change we're Shifting the mercury in the thermometer and politics despite its ugliness and its huge flaws is one of our biggest opportunities to raise our voices and if you want to know just how powerful it can be to raise our voices then look no further than my conversation with Incredible climate scientist Katherine heho okay thanks a lot for watching until next time bye by estimat BL BL"

    "transcript": "in just 150 years we've dramatically altered the workings of our planet burning fossil fuels and dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere has disrupted our oceans our ecosystems and our weather so what happens after we stop emitting and I mean long after which of these changes to our planet are here to stay and what does that mean for the choices that we make today I'm Adam a climate scientist with PhD from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change and today I want to peer into the deep future of our climate the lessons we can learn up to 50,000 years from today and there's a reason I want to talk about this right now you see I just hit 50,000 subscribers and whether you've been a climate since the very beginning or you're just joining for the first time right now I'm really thrilled you're here to talk with me about climate change to celebrate this Milestone I'm going to see if I can still do a handstand on a skateboard I'm saving that right for the end of the video so stay tuned but really in this video I want to peer into our climate future normally when we talk about the future of climate changes we talk about the coming decades maybe up to 2100 and fair enough that's pretty relevant to everyone live right now but the choices we make today how we treat each other and the planet won't just affect us they'll also affect our Legacy the world we're leaving for Generations long into the future so then what climate Legacy are we leaving for these future Generations well of course there are limits to what we can know so stick around for the crucial caveats towards the end of the video but first let's start by looking at the main climate change culprit carbon dioxide and I want to get out of my apartment for this in 150 years we've completely changed our planet let's visualize that 150 years as a single step in that one step we've raised CO2 levels in our atmosphere higher than they've been in millions of years so the question is how long until those levels drop back down before making this video I honestly didn't know the answer to this question and I was curious what you all thought as well and about half of you Reon that it would take centuries from now for levels to get back to normal just a few steps from where I am now well you got it completely wrong and I'm incredibly disappointed in you because the actual answer is tens to hundreds of thousands of years you see all sorts of processes remove carbon dioxide from their air some of them are faster like plants and the upper ocean absorbing CO2 that process is actually called ocean Invasion which well it sounds a lot more exciting than it is but these Speedy processes can only do so much and then it's a job for carbon dioxide to make its way all the way to the bottom of our seas and into ocean sediments and because our oceans are so incredibly massive this takes thousands of years but even after all that some 10,000 years in the future there would still be like a fifth of the carbon dioxide we emitted left in the atmosphere like I cannot stress enough how Wild this is all that CO2 we emitted in just one single step and a massive chunk of it would still be around 70 steps 10,000 years into the future I mean 70 steps into the past this was cuttingedge technology for CO2 to get all the way back down to its original levels it would need to get absorbed by rocks and if you've ever watched a rock H you'll know they're pretty slow which means we're looking at hundreds of thousands of years for CO2 levels to get all the way back down that's like the entire length of this Runway I'm stood on okay time to head back indoors since the CO2 in our atmosphere acts as a blanket insulating our planet a thicker blanket for a long ass time means a hotter planet for a long ass time so how hot for how long well once we stop emitting CO2 our best estimate is that temperatures quickly stop going up or down at least for the first few decades more information on why up here but the story a few thousand years into the future isn't actually that different one study calculated that 2/3 of the heating we cause will still be around 10,000 years into the future that's this far from where we are today now it's important to point out how scientists look at questions like this we obviously don't have some crystal ball or some spare Earth we can do experiments on so we have to build one instead we build model Earths where the atmosphere ocean ice forests they all work as accurately as possible capturing the processes that we see here on our real Earth this model doesn't sit on top of a table though it runs on some of the most powerful supercomputers that humans have ever built and these computer models are incredible allowing us climate scientists to ask questions like what will temperatures look like in 10,000 years but these models aren't perfect so their answers aren't perfect either in fact different models can give slightly different answers one thing all the models agree on though is that the changes we've already caused and that we're still causing today we're stuck with a lot of it for many thousands of years and when I say we I mean uh children's Children's children's Children's children's Children's children's and when I say it I don't just mean we're stuck with higher temperatures I mean we're stuck with extreme weather that's more frequent and more extreme we're stuck with regions made harder to live in and harder to grow food in we're stuck with ecosystems pushed way out of balance and if we've crossed them we could be stuck with tipping elements these are aspects of our planet which could effectively collapse to a different state and then it's very hard to get them back the vast ocean circulation in the Atlantic regulating the world's weather could switch off or huge amounts of carbon could be released from Frozen regions if these things do happen and temperatures stay high for many thousands of years it would be very hard for these collapses to reverse and being stuck with higher temperatures also means we're stuck with higher Seas but ice and oceans take many thousands of years to balance out with the new temperatures so it's not that our seas would just stay high for thousands of years they would actually keep Rising for thousands of years long after CO2 levels and temperatures peaked say we limit global warming to 2\u00b0 C that could mean about half a meter more sea level rise by the end of this Century enough to have serious consequences for the many millions of people living in coastal regions around the world but zoom out over the next 10,000 years and that's just the tip of the mostly melted Iceberg as se's would be some 10 m higher enough to redraw the lines on our maps and it's not like climate scientists are just guessing that this could happen we know that after our planet left the last ice age Seas kept Rising long after temperatures leveled out and past ice ages have something else to teach us too you see over the past hundreds of thousands of years the earth has experienced shifts in and out of these colder periods so the natural question is when will the next ice age start well a group of researchers looked at how carbon dioxide the Earth's orbit and the planet's ice are all linked they expect that the next ice age would start around 50,000 years into the future if humans hadn't emitted any carbon dioxide but we have emitted carbon dioxide and the emissions that we've already channed out today push the Ice Age way back making it highly unlikely in the next 120,000 years I don't say this because delaying the next ice age is necessarily inherently bad but this shows just how power powerful the planet altering effects of CO2 are half of the CO2 we've emitted we've emitted in just the last 30 years within my lifetime and this will have fundamental impacts on our planet not just over the coming decades but tens even hundreds of thousands of years into the future I mean 50,000 years into the past modern humans were making their way across the planet for the very first time and our actions today will profoundly affect our planet more than 50,000 years into the future as one of the studies I looked at in this video put it the decisions being made today will have profound and permanent consequences for future Generations as well as for the planet and today's decision makers do not have to live with the consequences of their decisions but let's take a deep breath because there are some very important disclaimers since we're talking about such vast time scales there's loads of other stuff that could happen in the meantime I'm talking volcanoes asteroids or honestly some processes that affect our planet's climate that we simply don't know or understand yet the projections described in this video are possibilities for our future not what will happen and on that note I know that these projections can make us feel powerless knowing that changes could stick around for so long but actually each and every one of these results makes clear just how much power we still have they show that actions we take to limit emissions now limit carbon dioxide concentrations not just today and tomorrow but for tens of thousands of years into the future and that means limiting the heating and all the other disruptive changes our planet goes through for all this time too which brings us to the biggest question mark in all of this us how quickly will we stop emitting and what will we do afterwards after all why stop at stopping emitting once we've learned to balance out our emissions why not keep cutting emissions and sucking up more and more CO2 why not shift from a society that treats the atmosphere and this entire planet as a Dumping Ground to a society that Treasures this home of ours and actively tries to restore it and look this channel is generally about what the science can tell us but how can science begin to tell us how our society will develop over the next decades centuries and Millennia so I know that this is very unscientific of me but I have to share that I really do believe that a kind of society that cares for community and the climate is possible and speaking of community it really does mean the world to me to have over 50 th000 of you climates here with me now I hate the idea of selling you all stuff that you don't need and so it's amazing being able to make videos like this one and not have to put ads or sponsor messages on it I can do that all thanks to my incredible patrons if you fancy it you can join them up here I don't know what this Channel's future will look like 50,000 more subscribers from now but I'm excited to go on that Journey with all of you and if you Valu this journey into our planet's distant future you might enjoy my trip into our home's deep past right enough about climate change time for the main event let's see whether I can still do a handstand on a skateboard okay until next time bye oh my gosh"

    "transcript": "heat waves are hitting us like never before summer is barely here in the Northern Hemisphere and we're already seeing people across the globe suffering under extreme heat and now research is making clear just how deadly these disasters can be so how is climate change turbocharging heat waves and what could we do to protect ourselves now and in the future I'm Adam a climate scientist with a PhD from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change and I didn't want to be making this video right now you see I just hit 50,000 subscribers and I planned a special video to celebrate that I was all ready to film and then this but seriously I am thrilled to have over 50,000 of you incredible climates in this community thank you all so much for being here and that celebration video is still coming and it's going to be a really good one peering into the deep future of climate change if you're not already make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss it okay but there's an important reason that I'm not making that video right now and it's because heat waves have been devastating our world and I really mean the world here there's been devastating heat all over temperature soaring above 50\u00b0 C in Mecca killing over a thousand people who are making the hge pilgrimage more than four out of every five us Americans sweltering under extreme heat thanks to a weather phenomenon known as a heat Dome and then there's been the heat hitting Europe and Southern Asia and Eastern Asia so in sumary an extreme amount of extreme heat but as countless commenters Delight in pointing out uh we had heat waves before climate change too and they're right we did but today heat waves hit different you see by burning fossil fuels we're pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and heating the planet and surprise surprise heating the planet is making heat waves that used to be extremely rare more extreme but less rare but what might actually be a surprise is just how huge this effect can be for example scientists analyzed the start of the North American Heatwave and found that the extreme daytime temperature were made about 35 times more likely because of climate change the record-breaking nighttime temperatures around 200 times more likely in fact researchers have found that every single Heat Wave happening these days is made hotter and more likely because we're heating the planet so why why is extreme heat getting such extreme boosts from global warming well the technical explanation is that changes in the average have supersized effects on extremes but let me give you a less technical more anecdotal explanation if you've been watching this channel a while you might recognize it but cut me some slack I needed to make this video in like 2 days so I grew up in the UK but now live in Germany people in Germany are on average taller than people in the UK and as someone with average height for an adult British human I noticed this a lot when I moved here I definitely saw a lot more people who were 6' tall but I also noticed quite a few people who are 6' three a height that would be pretty rare in the UK what I really noticed though was the Super tall people you know their height so tall I basically never see anyone that tall in the UK but here occasionally I would see these people who had previously thought of as impossibly tall it's just the same with changes in temperature Shifting the average temperature up has heat boosting effects on every Heat Wave but by far the biggest impacts are on the most extremely tall I mean the most extremely hot events which go from being incredibly rare maybe even effectively impossible to actually happening and unlike all the tall people in Germany who at their worst give me a crick in my neck all this heat can be deadly while the Carnage they cause is much harder to visualize than it is for floods or fires or droughts heat waves are silent Killers too much heat means that the body can't regulate its internal temperature and your organs literally get too hot to function that means heat exhaustion and then eventually heat stroke and recent research looking at Europe shows that in just 20 years heat related deaths have shot up by almost a third this affects the most vulnerable Among Us think of little babies you know your elderly relatives and people who already have health issues but other people at high risk too you see the basics of protecting ourselves from heat waves aren't rocket science it's stuff like staying hydrated and staying cool indoors but how do you do that if you don't have decent housing or don't have housing at all or if you have to work outside to earn a living so we have to do more to protect the most vulnerable people from extreme heat this can mean better education so that people know what to do and what not to do when extreme heat hits it can mean better infrastructure whether that's better housing or short-term cooling centers and it can mean better support networks checking in on those vulnerable people in our communities but the hotter we make the Planet the more severe heat waves will have more often as we're already seeing today but the flip side of that is that once we stop heating the planet in other words we stop burning fossil fuels and stop emitting CO2 we stop heat waves getting worse so we should probably do that as soon as possible and if you need another reason to stop heating the planet here's what could happen to the Amazon rainforest if we don't get our AXS together okay until next time bye"

    "transcript": "you've probably heard of a Tipping Point right A system that has a point Beyond which just a small change can suddenly dramatically change the whole system you may have heard of climate tipping points for example if the world warms too much Arctic permafrost might melt releasing tons of methane into the atmosphere or the Atlantic meridianal overturning circulation might shut down plunging Europe back into Ice Age conditions but did you know there are also climate tipping points that scientists want us to hit they're called a positive Tipping Point is a point where a small change can have a disproportionate effect after which the system becomes self-propelling to be extremely clear these tipping points are not physical like the circulation in the Atlantic or the Amazon rainforest dying back instead these are social or technological tipping points so for instance if one more person buys an electric vehicle that creates a positive interaction with other people making this the dominant technology really good example not that long ago there were barely any electric vehicles on the road and so when somebody bought one and drove it around it showed other people that these things existed but also that they were cheap to run that they didn't produce any tailpipe emissions and that they were quiet and that made other people more likely to buy one and that effect only became more pronounced the more people bought electric cars if we put time on our horizontal axis and electric vehicle uptake on our vertical axis then uptake will look something like this over time to begin with basically nobody is buying electric vehicles but as that positive feedback loop starts to kick in driver starts seeing other electric vehicles on the road then the curve starts shooting upwards eventually it gets really really steep which can't last forever it has to level out like this because eventually everybody's going to have an electric car the system has changed to a new state if that sounds ridiculous to you as an example you might want to look at Norway electric cars now outnumber cars with internal combustion engines in Norway and in July this year over 94% of all new cars bought there were electric the transport sector in Norway reached a Tipping Point I made a whole video about why there specifically on nebula and other countries are on a similar trajectory sure the US for example is down here on the S curve less than 10% of new vehicles bought in the US this year were electric vehicles but China is about here more than 50% of new vehicles bought in China this year were electric but electric vehicle uptake isn't the only low carbon system with a Tipping Point scientists have identified several Key Systems relevant to climate where change can be modeled as an S curve we'll come back to that where we're seeing the early stages of exponen potential growth with a huge shift a Tipping Point on the horizon so what are these systems this paper interviewed experts from across Academia and identified six climate tipping points that could be reached in the next 15 to 30 years though the paper doesn't call them tipping points they instead call them social tipping elements because Academia these tipping points were more information becoming available about our carbon footprint increased awareness and understanding of climate change oh hey that's what I public opinion turning against fossil fuels the withdrawal of financial support for fossil fuel extraction I made a whole video about that cities becoming carbon neutral I just made a video about this and low carbon energy yielding higher Financial returns for producers than energy produced by burning fossil fuels that last one is seen as particularly important because energy literally underwrites civilization unfortunately however we are still a way off that Tipping Point psych we're already there this paper was published in 2021 back when they said of this energy Tipping Point the empirical data show that this critical threshold is about to be reached the prices of Renewables have dropped sharply in the last few years and they have already become the cheapest source of energy in many world regions this year the International Energy agency estimates that $3 trillion will be spent on energy and of that 3 trillion 2 trillion will be spent on clean energy and infrastructure total spending on renewable and grids is for the first time greater than total spending on oil coal and gas the positive Tipping Point in energy has been reached and we can see that really clearly in this report from nonprofit RMI which found clear exponential growth in global solar deployment and battery cells far outpacing any previous predictions we're currently living in the Steep part of the energy scurve though it is important to note that energy doesn't just mean electricity energy use means electricity use but also transport heating cooling industrial applications agriculture loads of different sectors the energy Tipping Point that we have reached is really a Tipping Point in electricity production the carbon intensity of other uses of energy especially transport has basically remained the same though the fraction of all the energy we use that comes from electricity has been steadily increasing which is great news because if you can elect fire sector and then power it through Renewables you can really lower its carbon intensity and make it much more efficient and if you want an example of where this is happening really quickly look at China China has recently rolled out a truly staggering quantity of Renewables especially solar last year they added more solar capacity than the US has in its entire history the reason for this is because the price of solar panels especially Chinese solar panels has plummeted solar electricity is now the cheapest form of energy for lots of applications hence why the Chinese energy economy is becoming increasingly electrified but cheap Chinese solar panels isn't just good news for China so because China is one of the main producers the price the cost to to produce electricity has become quite similar in different countries because most countries imported from China which means that in some sense we have more of a global tipping points than in some other sectors like heat pumps which have very highly variable prices across countries that said some technologies like wind for instance do have European producers that produce for very low costs as well but we didn't just hit that solar Tipping Point with cheap solar panels and exponential uptake by Chance the authors of this paper and scientists more generally are Keen to stress that we don't just need to wait for these tipping points to happen in fact through smart government policy we can accelerate our progress towards them and our way down the S curve with targeted interventions get away for example how exactly did solar panels become so cheap I'm oversimplifying but starting in the late 2000s the Chinese government started providing large cheap lowrisk loans to Chinese solar companies which took those loans scaled up their operations started to benefit from economies of scale and invested in R&D and the result are solar panels that are 10 times cheaper now than they were at the start of the century it was a government policy designed to intervene in the Solar Market obviously to benefit Chinese interests but also to bring down the cost of solar electricity and other such interventions are known to exist going back to the 2021 paper interventions that could accelerate us hitting the non-energy Tipping points include the creation of specifically carbon neutral cities inspiring building codes elsewhere promoting the investment movement reducing the value of fossil fuel assets simulations suggests just 9% of investors divesting from fossil fuels could be enough to tip the whole system and improving resources available to Educators about climate change but why stop with just trying to flip one system into a new state what if you could design a small precise intervention that would cause a Tipping Point Cascade multiple systems one after another flipping into new stes well FEMA has just released a new paper on what she calls super leverage points so we identified two super leverage points in uh in our work one is a call phase out if we can accelerate a call phase out depending on on how far countries are along and force countries to use cheaper solar and wind and batteries then that can drive down electricity costs which because we're electrifying everything has rep Rion in all the other sectors a previous study also found that mandating fertilizers be produced with a certain fraction of green ammonia so that's ammonia produced with hydrogen made through renewable electricity as another Super leverage point because that would mean through economies of scale green hydrogen becomes more affordable and so hydrogen-based Solutions in other sectors like shipping and steel become more viable though still not heating houses just get in the bin with that idea but the other super leverage point identified in this new study which was the first one to quantitatively look for these tipping points in the electricity sector is a mandate for electric vehicles if you put such a mandate in place this has repercussions on all three other sectors we studied so for the trucks it's quite simple it's the same or very similar technology so innovation in one technology will also lead to innovation in the truck phace the second one is that the battery in cars can be used in the power sector in three ways so you've got vehicle to grid applications you've got a secondhand Market of these batteries and the third one is that you also have battery that you would buy for your grid independent of these cars and you can use those uh Insight from Innovation from cars for your power sector applications so that becomes cheaper which also means that electric cars become cheaper heat poops become cheaper because electricity is cheaper but just a minute minute I I'm going to do something that I don't usually do in these videos I'm going to step outside of the discussion I'm going to need a coat hang on we are talking about making changes to society that will have huge impacts and this is something that is a constant Factor when you're talking about climate stuff but it feels especially pointed here because you're by Design talking about making the smallest possible changes to produce the largest possible impact and while we call them positive tipping points we can't ignore the fact that there will be negative consequences associated with hitting some of them for example if you phase out coal then that's going to negatively impact people who are employed in the coal industry and that can be entire areas now I'm not trying to say that we shouldn't have a coal phase out because I very much think it is a net positive thing to do but we can't ignore those negative consequences so the question of who gets to decide which tipping points are targeted and in what Manner is an important one should it be politicians designing these policies or should it be scientists if so which politicians which scientists should this be a democratic process where everybody get a vote because this will impact everyone or is democracy too slow to implement change at the pace that we need the Tipping points group at the University of exter has the statement in one of their papers that if we don't decide this stuff now the future will decide for us and that version of the future will almost certainly be worse for us I don't think many people would disagree with that but it still sidesteps the question of who exactly gets to decide I would be very interested in what you have to say about this please leave a comment with who you think gets to decide this stuff because everybody should have an opinion about this this is huge stuff we're talking about that will impact everyone and I'm just a physical scientist by training I'm not a political or social scientist let alone a philosopher who do I think has the right to make this decision I I can't say I don't know what I can say in this video is that the world is currently hurtling towards various tipping points and we're likely closer to many of them than you think and while many of those tipping points are negative some of them are positive and if we hit those ones first it could profoundly change how we live our lives and how much damage we do to our planet oh uh yeah not everybody agrees on what is and isn't a Tipping Point and some social scientists argue that physical scientists are borrowing techniques from their field and implementing them sloppily or too broadly or without a full enough understanding of the literature and they suggest that one of the reasons why physical scientists are doing this is because it gives them it gives us hope the sustainability imperative that dominates much of Global Science and governance processes today combined with the sense that we are running out of time is a key motivator for social tipping research and it's success in review processes as the possibility of failure is looming larger every day we are eager to find new levers of change that can speed things up and Trigger rapid Transformations towards new sustainable stable States and there are certainly some dubious studies that draw historical parallels that I'm not convinced are necessarily appropriate and maybe assume a level of control over some systems that we can't be sure that we have I'm mentioning this for completeness sake I'm not trying to say that tipping points don't exist I think they do I think most academics would agree with me but perhaps they are not as numerous as they are in the literature and I do think that we need to be careful in how we discuss them but here's the rub just as there are physical negative climate tipping points that we don't want to hit there are social and technological positive climate tipping points that we do however we cannot fall into the trap in discussing these positive tipping points that we can somehow fix climate change with just a few targeted policy interventions people have just got to stop believing in nudge Theory it doesn't work the transition to a low carbon future is going to be hard it's going to take a lot of work and time across basically every sector but it's already happening and in certain sectors progress can leap and indeed is leaping forwards and maybe just maybe in these sectors there are a few government policies that if properly enacted can cause not just a Tipping Point in one area but a Tipping Point Cascade and I don't think the hope we can take from that idea is a false one now if you've seen a YouTube video before this is where you might expect me to say hey remember that video I mentioned earlier about electric cars on nebula well you can sign up with this link but no I'm not going to do that instead I'm going to tell you about this half hour documentary I made about designing and building this new YouTube studio and this hourlong actual play video of climate scientists playing the best board game about fixing climate change and my video about Norway and electric cars the point being I've made a lot of stuff that's available on nebula nebula is like Netflix for people who like trains it's a place where some of your favorite creators upload thoughtful videos to a platform that we co-own our videos are available on nebula before anywhere else and in many cases aren't available anywhere else I've already met mentioned some of my exclusive content but there are more than a hundred creators doing so such as real life law NY red climate town and Tom Nicholas and then of course there's the content produced by nebula such as the getaway this is a show starring a range of YouTubers traveling across America competing for a cash prize by completing tasks and trying to sabotage the other contestants it has possibly the best twist I've ever seen in one of these shows which I don't want to ruin you'll just have to watch it for yourself a subscription to to nebula that allows you to watch everything ad free and also to download videos to your device for I don't know long train Journeys is split between nebula itself covering costs and financing new shows like the getaway and the creators that you watch so by watching my videos on nebula you directly support my work far more than by giving me a view on YouTube and frankly you also get a better viewing experience too to get such a subscription which is usually $6 a month head to / Simon Clark where you can get 40% off an annual plan meaning it costs just $25 a month that's $25 a month to get access to a huge library of highquality thoughtful content free yourself from watching ads and support independent creators like me nebula.com a huge thank you to those people who support me over on patreon.com/crashcourse Johnson very long-term supporter of this Channel and Diddy Barry truly you are the fastest of all patrons if you'd like to watch another video from me here's to I prepared earlier please do the YouTube pleasantries pop me a like leave your thoughts in a comment

    "transcript": "if you think about it cities are amazing cities are the accumulation of human endeavor layer upon layer of history with the bones sticking out into the present long ago people found a place that looked nice and built houses houses that became homes homes that became communities we connected each other with social institutions some more secular than others and connected our homes with roads As Cities grew new Services appeared to protect the community and to serve it new infrastructure was built reshaping the landscape new buildings were constructed to integrate with a global Community providing new Services new ways of making a living and new ways of well living and as the last layers of History are laid down a city is further from its natural beginnings than ever before and faces new challenges in the 21st century cities home to over half the world's population must adapt to a warmer climate in fact those living in urban areas especially those from economically and socially marginalized communities will disproportionately suffer the effects of climate change with cities disproportionately contributing to the problem they make up over 70% of total greenhouse gas emissions so a large part of addressing the climate crisis is making our cities lower carbon but what about negative carbon can we build cities that actually suck carbon out of the atmosphere well according to this paper yes Mendes etal proposes four key ways cities can become carbon syn sinks in this video we'll explain these four ways Implement them in our model City and see how they measure up to the problem at hand the first way is perhaps the most obvious through Greenery green spaces in cities include Gardens parks and even forests expanding these will obviously draw down carbon through photosynthesis but so too will Green Storm water infrastructure much of the modern city is built from impermeable materials like concrete and tarmac when it rains heavily water courses over these materials and can rapidly accumulate causing flooding and flushing pollution into local waterways while this has been historically managed by pipes and tunnels green storm water infrastructure absorbs and filters storm water when it falls using plants this can be accomplished with green roofs and walls rain Gardens and bios swes these are green spaces designed to capture runoff so it can soak into the soil over time managing storm water in this way is an example of a co- benefit to a city of increasing Greenery while the main objective is to be a carbon sink you can accomplish other things too by protecting or building new green spaces in cities you increase people's connection to Nature restore biodiversity and lower temperatures trees provide shade and through a vapor transpiration cool down the local area really quite significantly oh and suck carbon out of the atmosphere it's estimated that if cities really lent into greenify their spaces globally they could draw down between 100 and 300 million tons of CO2 every year that sounds like a lot but remember last year the world emitted around 40 billion tons of CO2 greenify the world cities would be the equivalent of removing the emissions of a large European country pretty good but not enough maybe we'll have more luck with the second technique which is a little deeper and I mean that literally it's the soil cities are built on Urban soil is mostly Limited in how well it can support life by its capacity to hold water and nutrients some scientists propose to improve soil's capacity to hold both by adding biochar this is organic material burned at very high temperatures without oxygen similar to Charcoal but unlike charcoal in theory creating biochar does not create carbon emissions instead it's a way of taking carbon that might quickly make its way into the atmosphere for example through rotting and fixing it into a chemically stable form that isn't going to go anywhere add biochar to the soil or green roofs or storm water infrastructure in a city and you improve the growing conditions for plants aiding biodiversity but you also bury the carbon in the biochar for potentially centuries if that organic material was sustainably sourced or if it was waste product from sewage or garden waste it becomes another carbon sink with co- benefits for the city sounds great but a lot of people have problems with this idea I'll leave a link to a paper critiquing bioart in the description but in short it's very possible to create this stuff in an unsustainable way and there's no guarantee that it's a net positive for soil Health but assuming that this can be done sustainably surely this is a way to fix massive amounts of carbon into urban soil well according to mes at out actually maybe just 50 million tons a year equivalent to the emissions of Bulgaria and even then there's lots of uncertainty that the authors note we may need to look at the Third Way of drawing down carbon for something more substant and you can't get much more substantial than buildings roads infrastructure similar to the previous point if you lock carbon into a building then it might stay there for hundreds of years organic building materials like wood Can Be an Effective carbon sink again if sustainably sourced and while not everything can be made of Timber the list of buildings that can't grows ever shorter new materials like cross laminated Timber and glue laminated beams allow Woods to be used in even high-rise buildings with the added benefits of taking fewer emissions to produce and generally being faster to build with cities are going to expand significantly this century and Mendez ated out estimate that if new Urban construction was largely done with sustainably sourced Timber Products you could draw down one or 200 million tons of CO2 a year still not much however if you're willing to accept that biochar is a possible solution and again many people have problems with it but if we do then a bigger carbon sink becomes available in cement cement currently has a large carbon footprint though that's not guaranteed I've made a whole video about this and if you can make cement in a low carbon way then adding biochar to it can make it more durable and a huge carbon sink we're talking the equivalent of between 200 and 700 million tons of CO2 every year being locked away in new buildings that's the biggest number we've heard so far though it does have a lot of caveats not least of which by CH before we talk about the final way of making cities carbon negative just a brief aside about roofs a question I get asked occasionally is can't we just paint our roofs white and reflect some of the sunlight back and call the planet that way well the answer is yes and the paper finds that doing so could be the equivalent of preventing 8 billion tons of CO2 being released though note that's a oneoff between now and 2050 it's not 8 billion tons every year you can actually also push it much further if you also made roads slightly lighter though that obviously has an upper limit you don't want to Dazzle people the carbon Savings of doing this are pretty good maybe wiping out a few months of global emissions arguably though the bigger reason to do it is the side effect of local cooling similar to trees painting roofs white can cool down the local environment by the best part of a degree but unlike trees you can implement this anywhere you have a roof even on older buildings where a green roof would be impossible anyway that aside the final way the paper proposes making cities carbon negative is well you know how large buildings have heating and cooling systems that also circulate the air well a lot of that air is carbon dioxide two or three or more times atmospheric levels so given that there's concentrated CO2 available in an environment with a system that already circulates air what if we added to that system the ability to absorb CO2 and suck it out of our buildings doing so could remove a 100 million tons of CO2 a year and improve air quality in buildings but that's just capturing the CO2 you then have to safely store the CO2 and keep it stored presumably somewhere out of the city and that will be a lower number than 100 million tons a year this is a form of direct air carbon capture and to be quite honest I'm very skeptical of this as a solution simply put there are better cheaper Solutions available that we've already talked about so hang on a minute between the four approaches Greenery soil construction materials and carbon capture this paper estimates that you could maybe suck a billion tons of CO2 a year out of the atmosphere that's about 3% of our current emissions it's not enough in case it wasn't clear sucking carbon out to the atmosphere isn't how we tackle the climate crisis we do that by reducing our emissions within a city that means changing how we power our systems and heat our homes it me means changing how densely we live and how we move ourselves around it means changing what food we grow and how we distribute it this needs to be our priority but that's not to say that implementing this paper's suggestions is a bad idea because it's not just about carbon we can improve our storm water management connect people with nature improve the health of our soils and our people and cool ourselves down and when we do bring emissions down a billion tons a year will be a big deal by 2050 that might be a fifth of all emissions remaining from all cities it might be what's necessary to bring us to net zero emissions and along the way we can make cities that are more pleasant to live in for us and for other species I hope that the cities of the middle Century look something like this the next layer of history that says to the future we saw the problem and not only did we fix it we made things better as I mentioned this video is based on this paper by Mendes etal kind of translating it into everyday language unfortunately a lot of science is written in language that's quite inaccessible especially if you don't have an education in statistics if you watch a lot of videos like this one are interested in science but don't feel able to read actual scientific papers then I'd recommend this course on exploring data visually which leads on to courses on probability data analysis and modeling you can try this course for free with this video sponsor brilliant.org brilliant is the website and app where you can pick up new skills or support classroom learning in science maths and data science as you can see for yourself their courses are gorgeous and crucially Interactive Learning by just copying stuff out of a book or listening to lectures is nowhere near as effective as learning by doing and the award-winning team of brilliant including professionals from MIT Google and Caltech have built hundreds of courses at a variety of levels that I wish were available when I was at University I've already mentioned their data analysis course but you could also learn about programming large language models or mathematics and as I also already mentioned you

lot of work but also a lot of fun if you're interested the buildings came from Brigade models and their 2mm range I actually made an extra video going behind the scenes and showing you how I modeled and painted everything which is available right now on my patreon quite simply I would not be able to make these videos without my patrons and especially not a video like this one that took 2 weeks to make they literally keep the lights on here and in exchange they get early access to videos they get access to exclusive content every month notably a behind the scenes Vlog which is some my editor Luke's best work and producer tier Patron and hire whose names you're seeing on screen right now get to vote on a video topic a month and this video in fact was chosen by such a poll so if you'd like

    "transcript": "this might be my favorite board game ever and it does something impossible it accurately represents the climate crisis and is still fun to play to explain how I filmed me playing it with some professional Gamers o if anyone's got a holdy hand what what are those called again the society tag Society tag and with a group of climate scientists I'm worried about Georgia I think we'll use the women's empowerment to destroy the youth climate move [Laughter] this is Daybreak a game from Matt Lok who you may know as the creator of pandemic and Mato menache and for transparency I don't know these creators they don't know I'm making this video I just really love their game in it players take the Reigns of different regions of the world the USA Europe China and the rest of the world and they have lots of tools at their disposal to combat the climate crisis at the start of the game each region is is producing a ton of carbon emissions from fossil fuel electricity generation but also from industry agriculture transport and various other sectors as represented by these tokens the main part of the game consists of turns playing cards from your hands to remove these emissions tokens with each card representing a possible response to the climate crisis ranging from decarbonizing electricity supplies to restoring ecosystems and even geoengineering the cards have tags representing different are of response from social to ecological to energy and a large part of the game is spent playing cards in Stacks to either allow a card's ability to be activated or buffing the effect of a card you only have five slots in which to play cards and you can only activate a card's ability if it's on top of a stack so there's lots of interesting decisions to be made and tradeoffs to be had in how you decarbonize perhaps it's best to show you how the game plays with one of the games I recorded So I borrowed the games night room from Yogscast Studios incidentally if you like board games definitely check out their games night Channel I'm in one of their Warhammer battle reports and I introduce the game to three friends I am playing as the majority World America Europe and I'm China each region has a different thematic starting hand of cards but also a different mix of emissions to manage and will grow by different amounts as the game progresses I think I'm going to discard this card to get one clean electricity and then I'm going to cover this card with this one uh Bri I use my special drawing rights to give you resistance of your choosing you make it sound like magic the Gathering but what I will do is I will tuck it behind uh my reforestation oh which I can do once per turn and I'll will have two to four nature of things we can add a tree so how much have we reduced our emissions by in turn one I got rid of one of mine zero I don't think I've reduced mine none I'm not removing emissions but I'd be gaining a green energy but right now I'm meeting the requirement right now you were but at the end of next turn if you don't meet the requirements I think you can Edge it for a turn okay is that how it wordss it in there yeah I'm pretty sure there the exact wording climate edging as well as supporting decarbonization in your own region players can also play cards to support Global projects which help everyone Often by allowing trade between players and how do we contribute to that Global project so you tuck a card so I actually have a card here that I could tuck underneath but we'd need another one is it looking for specific symbols yes you're looking for the money symbol money symbol I'm going to discard that one instead and I'll tuck my money one under there and players can take actions which limit the effects of Crisis cards speaking of which at the end of every turn all players remaining emissions tokens generate cute little carbon cubes which are added to a global pool some are removed by ocean absorption and photosynthesis and the remaining carbon cubes are added to the global thermometer if you fill a band of the thermometer with carbon cubes the temperature increases by a tenth of a degree uh TOS up what your total emissions are so I've got 25 20 17 oh my god well that's terrifying yep oops but that's our gross missions so the net emissions we need to subtract so seven of the big ones go and then we've got another five can go and another one we've warmed the World by a tenth of a degree and then we've made Sumer Headway to the next 10th of a degree and as the temp temperature on the thermometer Rises more and more negative effects start occurring you roll a dice to represent the chance of hitting Global tipping points such as the Amazon dying back or Arctic sea ice melting once for each tenth of a degree on the thermometer with each Tipping Point having a different effect and you draw increasing numbers of Crisis cards representing the direct and indirect effects of climate change ranging from geopolitical crises to wildfires to pandemics and the interference of the fossil fuel industry which makes players jobs much harder something that happened repeatedly in the game with the climate scientists Dan do you want to flip over the last card fossil fuel disinformation oh god oh no the game continues until either you've played six turns the global thermometer reaches 2\u00b0 or any one region is engulfed in crisis those are the Bad Endings the good ending is if you can collectively bring the world to Net Zero that's how you win and it's important to note that you all win or you all lose this game isn't competitive it's collaborative in fact coordinating actions between players is absolutely key to Victory something that's very cleverly built into the design of the game so if I'm trying to convey something to you like the idea of global warming rather than having 20,000 cards that people read text on instead can you do it so that the mechanics themselves convey that information there's a massively powerful message for me when I play that game in that the climate crisis is not about individual guilt it's about Collective action this is Professor Sam illingworth of Edinburgh napia University who researches how we can use poetry and games to communicate science perhaps that's something you've never considered before but games allow people who would otherwise maybe have nothing to do with science to learn and have conversations about it unfortunately we have created what I call hierarch of intellect so this idea of I'm I'm not a scientist what do I know my opinion is not really worthwhile so we need to try and break down those hierarchies when we're around the gaming table we enter into a new set of social contracts our behaviors on the gaming table are different from away from the gaming table great example with a terrible game imagine we're playing Monopoly in Monopoly it's expected that I am trying to bankrupt you that is behavior that is morally repugnant away from the gaming table but a contract that we have entered into around the gaming table it means that we can then start to have conversations at a non-hierarchical level that might not be possible away from the gaming table right so we're now on turn two but I can p another tree hey guys China's got a major solar program and we playing this game hang on how far are you taking this I'm so scared for our pet right now yeah well if we were in charge my big stack is regular refrigerants is the single largest way we can reduce emissions as well like as a single solution so that does make sense that yeah that I saw that c of that's so powerful only 10 from China 10 really hang on eight and then what about your electricity ones oh wait those oh I didn't do these in the first round all right well you got oh no no I did is this how it often goes at climate meetings where they're like oh this dirty energy we forgot about the me forgot about that okay so that's all of our emissions okay that's a lot of emissions so basically last turn China was hiding their emissions and then it all came out the next year I really am Ro playing trainer fill that band and we fill that band that's concerning yeah that happened quite quickly to be very clear other games about or set within climate change exist in video games you have Final Fantasy 7 for example but also the Civ series Terror invictor and hathur socialism to name just a few you even have Escape rooms like emergency and of course board games Settlers of Katan has a new expansion about climate change Professor illingworth designed a deck building game called carbon City zero and there's also Evolution and CO2 Second Chance which I really want to check out but in my opinion Daybreak is the best game I've ever played about the climate crisis there's so many little things I love the artwork for one thing all the cards have beautiful art I really like the style even the one on that are associated with negative effects and this in particular I want this on my wall there's no plastic anywhere in the game including its packaging hell the dice are made of sustainably sourced wood each card comes with a QR code that takes you to a page on the game's website that tells you more about that topic and suggests further reading and I love that the game puts all the options on the table it's just clear that some of them are much easier to implement than others rolling out wind and solar for example is pretty easy to do even in the early game while nuclear does generate lots of electricity if you have the tags to actually activate the card decarbonizing electricity is much easier than removing other forms of emissions and you can suck more carbon out of the atmosphere instead of bringing down your emissions and it's much easier to do so through natural means than artificial ones but it's nowhere near enough to offset everybody's emissions and then there's oh I've got a load of geoengineering cards I'll know once per round you roll this Dice and you add one for every geoengineering thing in its stack and then you can effectively negate the amount of temperature bands that we have hit so if we roll well we could actually get rid of two temperature bands but if we roll low we add more crisis cards oh oh I'm trying to yeah do it I think that's too risky personally I don't know what other people feel about that I've got one as well and I agree at some stage I think I'm going to have a machine that that produces a lot of green energy and then I can give it oh you cance people amazing yeah I think I'm going to play my community wind project over universal healthcare which feels very odd let me gain one green energy once per round I really want to get rid of my factory these two cards to remove two factories from my emissions okay so if I do that but I put that up and get rid of the car yeah okay that's two down six from the rest of the world 14 11 from me oh okay these are lower numbers oh it does push us over so it does push us over unfortunately it does mean that things are going to start going a bit worse okay but I mentioned earlier that I also played the game with a bunch of climate scientists from the University of Bristol's climate Dynamics group and I asked them after the game what they thought of how the climate crisis was represented in Daybreak for me personally as a climate scientist it was a bit too much like work [Laughter] I think when you take the climate crisis in isolation this this is an amazing game and I think the the designers of this should really be um you know praised for that I lik The Tipping points a lot there were some things on it that a lot of people may not think about like Tha permafrost I think often gets overlooked also the specificities of like the different tipping points having different impacts so like some are going directly towards you know temperature some are going towards those crisis cards I thought that was very cool I think the major problem I have with it may is that once you reach throw down then you don't have to worry about anything else because the game is over I don't think that's actually a good representation because we should not just stop until we get there we should keep going everything has an effect on everything else so I think that is that is quite realistic I I think the thing that really stood out to me most was the representation of how like the society cards are representative of like 25% of the deck when you're on the science side of it if you're you know during doing climate modeling things sometimes you can tend to overlook the society impacts and things like you know Community ownership that I have here or um circular economy just like things that sort of directly impact people resilience volunteers came in clutch many many times well as did women's empowerment women's empowerment right and so I like that it's a climate game but it's not ignoring the human aspect of it the two I really like so loss and damage if it wasn't obvious this is incredibly flexible card you can use it to mitigate any of these crises in reality it might not be so flexible but it's a a very great thing to have that as a global fund the other one is a bit of a sort of left-wing one but it's this well-being budget and the health of our community is intrinsically linked with with the with the climate change problem and so actually just making a fitter healthier and happier Community would do wonders for climate change so we need to reduce emissions by seven that's all we need to do in order to reach draw down and then we just need to survive one this lot of crises if we can do that I'm putting Net Zero buildings under my stack of community wind which will allow me once per round to gain a green energy and also infrastructural protection this Mega stack is Domina the game of I could give you this one you put it on top and then you can get rid of two bad energy yeah I really need that oh my God amazing just see how much clean energy you yeah yeah yeah ridiculous cuz this discard one card you get two green energies per each solar panel I got three of those so discard one card I get six is everybody finished that's all I can do right so I've got 12 emissions four I have 10 of the big boys we can remove 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight woohoo Okay so we've hit draw down but now we've got to survive this bit we uh roll this dice four times okay ocean acidifications major weather systems and it finally oh no oh no that's here comes the crisy train okay desertification that's fine we get dessert Amazon D okay that that could have gone a lot worse quite tense now displacement Global financial crisis next round doesn't matter Fresh Water Crisis the player with the lowest ecological resilience loses one social resilience okay do that so we survived that round uh-huh that means I think that we've beaten climate change I'm not going to say it was easy yeah it was very stressful I don't think we were making another turn I think Daybreak does something impossible it within the limitations of still being a game accurately represents the climate crisis and what a necessary response to it looks like while still being fun to play that that shouldn't be possible it presents a complex puzzle that is so satisfying to solve and the mechanisms by which you solve it in the game teach you about how we can do the same thing in real life okay what did you think of it as a game I thought it was a stressful game but a very enjoyable game I liked building the big Stacks I liked like changing up the board in the world the crisis was terrifying having to make the difficult choices as well I guess I'll get rid of universal healthcare to get this useful thing in trying to like figure what to prioritize was kind of interesting I really enjoyed it I like that everyone was sort of working together and it's not just you know black and white you do this and it's good you do this there was that element of like oh I do need to you know have some give and take what's I think really good with this game is that everything you're doing does mirror something that actually reflects you know the climate crisis just The Logical nightmare of having to organize all of your cards I imagine is exactly what trying to come up with climate policy in government is like cuz you can't do everything cuz you can't do everything and also it's just so complicated so that matches that quite well in a way sort of like seeing the different tags and the cards and the the things that you're deciding on that helped me kind of realize like oh like like you telling me about the refrigeration like more regulation on sort of things like that I mean it's one of those things it's very easy to be like just start doing this but when you actually look at it you're like oh no there is a lot of like you can't just get rid of one type of energy overnight there's obviously going to be that process in real life our response to the climate crisis will need basically all of the solutions represented in Daybreak and most of those Solutions will require the support of the public through voting for political parties who promis to enact such legislation as such science communication around the climate crisis is key and it can't just be through traditional means like books and TV that's going to leave some communities behind if you want to reach everyone you need to use new formats to reach Niche audiences with information about the problem and its Solutions and games are an important way of doing just that and so originally I was going to finish this video by describing Daybreak as the perfect educational game but when I mentioned this to Professor illingworth he had this to say we don't want to have educational games we do not want edu games we want games that children adults anyone want to play if their own valtion any game that is designed to tackle any topic or any game that's used already exists like for the climate crisis for example we want to have games that are fun and well would you want to play the game again oh yeah yeah definitely yeah i' play this again absolutely now you may be curious to see how a group of climate scientists played this game so we recorded the entire game and it's available to watch in its entirety including some interesting discussion mid game of specific cards right now on nebula if you don't know nebula is the streaming service that's owned and operated by a bunch of video and podcast creators including me it launched in 2019 and since has become the most interesting fastest growing independent video platform on the internet with original programming financed by our subscribers including narrative feature films documentaries game shows and even a play which was excellent I was lucky enough to see it the idea of nebula is that if we as creators can control how our videos are financed and distributed we can both make higher quality stuff and offer a better viewing experience for our audiences by doing away with advertisers you get a distraction fore viewing experience and your subscription instead finances centralized tools for us creators allowing us to become more than the sum of our parts smaller creators get elevated in production value to the next level and all creators get a bit of financial flexibility which we can invest in our passion F projects like this video which took an awful lot of resources and time to make there is a vast library of exclusive original content available on nebula my exclusives include the game with climate scientists several video essays extended interviews with scientists and an entire course on how I make videos about science and that's just my stuff if you want a recommendation from the rest of the library then I particularly enjoy watching Lindsay Ellis's videos if you want to join a platform that is pushing entertainment forwards that is allowing creators to make bigger better projects that they simply couldn't be making otherwise and get access to highquality exclusive thoughtful videos from hundreds of creators then you should join nebula you can do so at nebula.com off nebula.com Simon oxf you also get early access to videos and produce a tier patrons and hire the names that you're seeing on screen right now get to vote on a video topic every month I've shuffled my Patron deck and I draw Liam maty Theo cuz one letter name invites ridicule Colin B and Daniel rafy I'd say that's a pretty solid hand thank you for supporting my patreon if you like the look of Daybreak then I'll leave a link to its website in the description again not sponsored just really like it there will also be links down there to briany ravs and Dom as well as to Professor illing and the climate Dynamics group at the University of Bristol thank you all for being part of the video if you'd like to watch something else from me next then here's two videos I prepared earlier if you enjoyed this video please do pop it a like and maybe give it a share and that just leaves me to say thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next one"

    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the 2048 Olympics here in Athens Greece it cannot be denied not the most impressive Olympics just two records have been broken by athletes representing a little over 100 countries competing in just 23 sports fans here have been nostalgic about the classic Olympics like 2008 2012 and even 2024 back when athletes representing over 200 countries participated in over 30 sports with huge crowds of Spectators watching athletes perform faster higher and stronger than anyone in human history this year small crowds a lower level of performance and even less interest from the public than in the disastrous last Olympics in Manila what happened and how much longer can the Olympic Games carry on this Century we can expect the Olympics to decline in popularity and Prestige and that's a pretty bold statement especially considering how well the current Olympic Games in Paris seem to be going but while there are many factors that will determine the quality of an Olympic Games this Century in this video I'm going to focus on the one factor that will likely override all of them climate change and I'm going to use this depression onitor to keep track of how depressing different sections of this video will be starting here with the most obvious Factor heat as I hope you're aware by now global average temperatures have increased by between 1 and 1 and 1 12\u00b0 C since pre-industrial times individual years like 2024 are warmer than that though maybe even more than 1 and A2 degrees warmer and individual regions have warmed significantly more than the average for example temperatures in Paris are 3.1 de C warmer at this time of year during the day than they were in 1924 when Paris last hosted the Olympics and you might quite reasonably ask is that really a big deal it's just a couple of degrees well if you're pushing yourself to the highest level of athletic performance yes to explain why here's YouTube's favorite cardiologist slmed influencer Dr Rohan Francis thank you Simon homeostasis is the body's incredibly sophisticated system of maintaining a constant internal environment and humans can actually operate through quite an impressive range of conditions but as temperatures climb that Thermo regulatory mechanism gets harder and harder the two main ways that we cool ourselves down are by diverting blood flow to the skin so that heat can radiate away and by sweating exercise itself of course generates a large amount of heat from your muscles and they can increase metabolic activity up to 15 times the resting rate if the environmental temperature is above or near body temperature you lose that passive Cooling and it's harder to maintain core temperature when core temperature starts creeping up metabolic processes within cells become less efficient more blood flow to the skin and a homeostatic mechanism to reduce that intrinsic heat generation means less blood flow to muscles including the most important muscle there is the oxygen Hungry Heart so performance dips heat exhaustion sets in quicker potentially progressing to heat stroke which can be fatal collapsing athletes are already familiar scenes in endurance events but remember this isn't just about what time of year to hold a specific race but athletes need to train year round so so if the optimum window gets shorter performance will decline unequally affecting athletes in warmer countries for example or those without access to controlled facilities but what about more explosive events like jumps or Sprints where you might think heat would actually help get muscles up to Optimum temperature while less affected than distance Runners and endurance athletes examining the Sprint world records for example show they were as far as I can tell generally all achieve between 18 to 30\u00b0 C some records have already stood for decades and if conditions worsen fairly soon it's possible they NE may never be beaten many many years ago I was quite a serious Sprinter and even then in that bygone Epoch we all noticed that on very hot days we felt drained even before we'd lined up in the blocks but then again increasing temperatures by a degree or two might negatively impact performance it's hardly the end of the world world right however when it comes to the Olympics specifically it's not just a question of a few degrees because extreme heat events in summer heat waves where temperatures are significantly warmer than average are becoming more common and more extreme due to climate change as the rings of fire report released ahead of the Paris Olympics points out the 2024 Olympics are being held at the same time of year that saw the 2003 heat wave in France where temperatures Rose to over 4 4\u00b0 C 15\u00b0 more than the average for August and killed over 70,000 people across Europe the fear was that something similar could happen this year granted the vast majority of fatalities in 2003 were among the elderly but asking athletes to perform in conditions like those conditions that by the way may become common place in European Summers because of climate change will result in more incidents of heat stroke and heat related fatalities that may sound hyperbolic but it's already happening between 2018 and 2022 11 American football players died from heat stroke we got a taste of this with the Tokyo games in 2021 which were the hottest Olympic Games ever temperatures hit 34\u00b0 C seeing two tennis players retire with heat exhaustion and Russia's Daniel meddev famously saying to the Umpire I can finish the match but I can die if I die are you going to be responsible and away from the tennis court the sand of the beach volleyball pitch was almost too hot to stand on and long-distance swimmers competed in water of 29\u00b0 C despite starting at 6:30 in the morning researchers at the sabon later describe these conditions as close to torture at the time of recording the Paris Olympics have not been as hot as Tokyo though a heat Dome bringing temperatures to nearly 40\u00b0 C in parts of France has formed and that has been attributed directly to climate change and that has meant that competitors have had to wear ice vests in order to stay cool and in some sports warm-ups have had to be curtailed and of course the men's Triathlon had to be delayed after Extreme rainfall flushed pollution into the sen leaving it unsanitary can't believe I wrote that generally speaking temperatures have been lower in Paris than experts feared and if they were higher Sports would now enact their heat protocols these vary sport by Sports and a good example is in the triathlon so the ideal temperature for racing would be somewhere in the mid 20s so early 20s to mid 20s is uh the air temperature that is considered ideal for racing for any kind of triathlon be it the short course or the long course that is what is ideal but most of these triathlons now increasing with the climate change have gone to 30 plus degrees there is almost so much that the core body temperature can increase before we start feeling fatigued and the effects of heat one one athlete might might not feel it as much on the cycling but when it comes to running the evaporation or the sweating becomes much more and the impact of the Wind on the body is also less the kind of the cooling effect goes away so the running is when as athletes we feel the most impact of the heat as such the world Triathlon medical team has a modified traffic light system if the event is going to take place in temperatures above 30 . 1\u00b0 C then the Run portion of the triathlon should be halved in length and if the event is going to take place in temperatures above 32.2 de C then the event should just be cancelled However if those temperatures seem low to you that's because they're not air temperatures they are wet bulb temperatures simply put that's the temperature as measured by a thermometer covered with a water soaked cloth at 100% humidity the wet bulb temperature is the same as the air temperature while at lower humidities the wet bulb temperature is lower than the air temperature because of the cooling effects of evaporation and that's relevant with regard to sweating because as the ambient temperature exceeds body temperature of 37\u00b0 C which for any Americans watching is about 558 ranking simply diverting blood to the skin for heat to radiate away won't cut it anymore so the body becomes more dependent on the other mechanism of cooling evaporation now some of this is actually via panting but of course most is through sweat maintaining electrolytes and hydration becomes harder but more fundamentally as humidity Rises sweating also loses its function as evaporation declines due to atmospheric moisture levels what's even worse is that as you sweat losing in excess of a liter per hour during intense exercise your blood volume decreases and your plasma tonicity or osmolarity increases is both rendering heat loss by either method less effective and humidity doesn't just mash up your ability to evaporate sweat it also affects breathing I found lots of studies looking at breathing symptoms and physiological measurements showing that people universally report that it's harder to breathe in high humidity and things like respiratory rate uh goes up but I'm not sure we fully understand why yet it does seem to cause Airway swelling especially in conditions such as asthma but but it might also be a property of how easily we can utilize the oxygen in the air so overall when atmospheric temperature is higher than body temperature and humidity is very high as well the body can no longer effectively regulate its temperature without some external assistance both of these are relevant to athletes now back to everyone's favorite Warhammer influencer and general per of bad news Dr Simon Clark now the bad news warmer air can hold more moisture that's just thermodynamics and over the past half century we have seen the global average specific humidity go up and the next of century we're going to see that Trend continue which combined with Rising temperatures will result in higher and higher wet bulb temperatures for athletes to compete in the humidity was part of what made the Tokyo games so punishing for the athletes they were competing in humidity of nearly 70% resulting in wet bulb temperatures above 32\u00b0 something that mercifully hasn't happened in Paris this year at least at the time of recording but this issue is only going to get worse the conditions in Tokyo will likely become the norm athletes will need to perform in ever more punishing conditions resulting in a degradation of the average quality of performance at the games especially affecting endurance events and it's not just going to affect the athletes if athletes are going to be performing at a lower level that's going to make the games slightly less exciting to watch athletes won't be jumping quite as high or running quite as fast fewer records will be broken and team sports will have to use slightly less Dynamic exciting strategies that will make the games slightly less appealing as will the increased number of Errors made by officials forced to endure the same brutal conditions but you know what's going to make the games much less appealing having to sit or stand in those conditions for hours at a time as an audience member it is possible to somewhat mitigate this as we've seen in Paris but I think it's quite likely that as the summer games heat up we'll see a gradual decline of audience members for non-air conditioned events there's going to be less Buzz around these events which unfortunately means there's probably going to be less funding available for highlevel athletes like a lot of funding for most of the sports comes from The Spectator pool that we have it all comes down to you know how weather Chang is impacting the number of people taking Sports and then how many people are actually interested in viewing the sport because that is how most of the sports get their money and this is where we need to leave the stadium or the road or the pitch or the beach because the Olympic Games themselves are just the final part of an athlete story and they don't get there without years and years of training and hold on to your hats because this is where we find out how this thing goes decreased audiences and interest means less funding will be available to athletes but so will the fact that the 21st century is going to see Rising costs of adapting to our new warmer more extreme climate sport is going to drop down the priority list many places will become so hot or so frequently hit by extreme weather events that it will be difficult if not impossible for athletes to train there and these two factors together mean that only the best supported athletes from the richest countries can afford to travel to train at the top level for any kind of weather condition be it cold or warm you if you train in that kind of weather that you're going to finally race in the most optimal results are achieved like you can give the best out of your body so I think that is definitely a concern like most of the countries wouldn't be able to afford something like this there will be a decrease in the diversity of athletes at the games and a decrease in the number of countes represented and those that do attend are still training in more challenging conditions and more susceptible to being disrupted by extreme events like wildfires droughts and storms India is a developing country right now and they can only fund so many athletes at the grassroot level the support is almost minimal it's like a chicken and egg story that you know you get so much support if you perform and how do you perform you need support and this isn't even to mention the fact that climate change is expected to increase the number of International conflicts this Century see our video on the century we saved Earth for an example of how and that's going to divert even more funding away from sport or the fact that by the mid-century around a dozen countries currently represented in Paris probably won't be inhabitable anymore when are we going to see the last Olympic delegation from the males or the martial Islands but perhaps most depressingly of all in a world where it becomes too hot to play outside in the summer fewer and fewer children will be involved in outdoor sports and events like the marathon and the triathlon May well disappear from the Grassroots up I've already been seen that a lot of kids are not physically active and a that is because of the weather B that is lack of facilities that are being available and C that is also because a lot of digital kind of sports have come into the scenario like video games so I think feather has the biggest impact that as parents also they're concerned that if their kids go to play in this warm condition they might fall sick so I think there is a big impact of number of kids going into physical activities if the pool gets smaller at the very start at the grassroot level then how will the heroes be created like you know how will Champions be recognized this paints a really Bleak picture for highlevel athletics this Century especially for those events that take place outside and that test endurance the results could well be a 2048 Olympics similar to what I described at the start of the video fewer countries represented fewer Sports lower level less attention but hold on just a minute compare the 1924 Olympics to the 2024 Olympics international sport now looks completely different it's much more organized better supported by national bodies and the technology available to athletes is simply incomparable the 100 m freestyle world record for men was 59 seconds in 1924 and just 46 seconds in 2024 that Improvement was made possible by new training techniques improved understanding of physiology and new technologies being used in swimwear in caps and in goggles as I said at the start of the video climate change will likely be the dominant Factor on international sport this Century but other factors still exist new technologies will be developed that will help keep athletes safe and maintain their level of performance new forms of media will rise up that will keep people interested in the games and in international athletes the games themselves can also adapt new heat protocols can be brought in events can be rescheduled to cooler times of the day as they already are and some even advocate for the Summer Olympic Games to be entirely rescheduled to a cooler time of the year though doing so will likely impact athletes training regimes the Paris games for their part have made headlines for their sustainability efforts setting a carbon budget limiting new construction and using 100% renewable electricity though those aims have come under a lot of criticism by academics for basically just being greenwashing citing a lack of specificity and transparency and an overreliance on carbon offsetting the games have also come under criticism for accepting sponsorship from polluters such as cocacola Samsung and Toyota that though it is worth noting that there are no sponsorship ties whatsoever with any fossil fuel producing companies fossil fuel sponsorship is still R in international sports however with national Olympic teams like team GB and the Australian National Olympic team accepting money in exchange for positive PR from companies such as British gas Hancock prospecting shell and others to quote the rings of fire report that I mentioned earlier if sport is going to take its sustainability and environmental commitments seriously to minimize the climate change impacts experienced by athletes and Spectators during sporting events it will need to conduct a radical reassessment of its relationship with fossil fuel companies athletes are in a bind here funding is hard and will only get harder to come by and fossil fuel extraction companies are offering it but to accept such deals is to accept a deal with the Devil rehabilitating the image of and extending our dependence on fossil fuels sport is a story of IND indviduals making tough choices and prevailing against the odds it could be a fantastic example of how Society can move past fossil fuels and instead Embrace a more sustainable future and if athletes and Spectators take a stand and boot fossil fuel companies out of sport then we increase the odds of sport as we know it surviving bringing down our emissions limiting our damage to the climate will the 2048 Olympics really look like this have the Olympics peaked and will now face a decline maybe the challenges facing International Athletics in maintaining the current level of competition in running large events and most importantly in keeping athletes safe are immense but the tools at our disposal for making that happen are also immense sport brings people together in a way that basically nothing else does and the Olympics are perhaps the most awesome thing that we do as a species I predict that people aren't going to let that go without a fight oh and for completeness I thought I'd close by talking about the future of the Winter Olympics I made a diarama normally I end these videos like this showing you the names of the patrons who made this video possible and imploring you to join them at patreon.com Ox Fizz but because this video was about the Olympics I thought we could do something a little bit different it's not an Olympic event but welcome to the patreon marble race if you would like to become a patron of this channel then you get early access to videos you get exclusive content every month including a behind the scenes Vlog every month that some of my editors best work and producer tier patrons and hire get to vote on a video topic a month also executive producer patrons as well as Steven Spielberg and Henry cavaler patrons get their names up in lights or at least in the video and congratulations to the gold medalist Alina Dima with Soo Silvera going to Angelo and shameful shameful Bron going to Yan thank you so much to pragna and to Dr Francis for chatting to me please do check out rohan's YouTube channel it's linked down there in the description he makes phenomenal videos when his job as a consultant cardiologist allows and thank you very much for watching if you would like to learn more about this topic then please do read the full rings of fire report and I can also recommend warming up how climate change is changing sport I'll leave links to both of those down in the description if you'd like to watch something else from me next then here's two videos on screen I prepared earlier and that is pleas me to say thank you for watching I'll see you in the next one"

    "transcript": "ending climate change requires the end of capitalism we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is the money you are absolutely going to see more climate activists call for anti-c capitalist practices and Market regulation and I believe in capitalism but we don't necessarily use it correctly or it's broken in some very important ways capitalism amongst a lot of climate activists and environmentalists the word capitalism has become a sort of four-letter word in fact maybe you should bleach that like capitalism but what's the alternative are we just supposed to abolish capitalism what does that even mean why can't we just fix it and hey what even is capitalism anyway hi I'm Hazel there AKA Hazel is online I spent four years in school learning economics and then another four unlearning it and if you're expecting Simon to be here on his own channel well he's taking July off as a sabatical to build his new studio so I'll be your economics substitute teacher for the day now just because Simon's gone doesn't mean you're allowed to just start acting up in class okay do not try me I'll leave a note and if you like this video there's more where that came from on my Instagram Tik Tok and new YouTube channel so capitalism can it save the planet well as you might guess by the color of my hair and what I'm like as a person I have some thoughts see the point environmentalists usually make about capitalism is this in a profit-driven extractive system that chews through both people and the environment to make a quick buck we can't just sit and cross our fingers and toes and hope that maybe one day corporations will wake up and suddenly decide to care about the environment so what's so wrong with capitalism anyway in theory capitalism should be perfectly efficient companies should compete to be the most coste effective and eco-friendly and clean energy should compete to be the lowest cost Fuel and the Invisible Hand of the free market should be able to you know crank down the thermostat but instead the Invisible Hand is punching the climate right in its invisible face There's No Business incentive to save the rainforest or the whales or the biosphere that allows human life to exist under pure free marketon capitalism a tree isn't worth anything until it's been cut down and puled and not only that but our current system of capitalism requires those profits to grow every year we need to pulp even more trees every single year or else the pulpy is going to go out of business and if companies don't make more money every single year the economy doesn't grow and if the economy doesn't grow that's what we call a recession so what exactly do I mean by there's no incentive for companies and rich people to just clean up their acts and switch to Green Technology well to understand that you need to understand externalities here's a little example imagine you live in a nice quaint town by the river let's call it Rivertown I don't know I'm an economist not a writer anyway in Rivertown you drink drink the river water your kids play in it you fish from it and life is good but suddenly a company opens upstream and starts dumping sewage into the river you don't want your kids and your fish to be covered in poop so when the crap starts to flow Downstream your town has to spend thousands of dollars cleaning up the company's mess but since sewage R Us makes thousands of dollars dumping the sewage they keep doing it and you have to pay the cost not them this is called an externality the company has no reason to stop dumping or to spend any of its own money cleaning up its act so why would it might as well pass your externality down to the town and to make things worse if it costs you more money to clean up the mess than they make making it the entire economy loses money economists call this a market failure and scientists call it climate change because instead of Rivertown it's all of humanity and instead of sewage it's civilization threatening Planet torching greenhouse gases isn't economics fun we don't live in pure unregulated free market capitalism the government is supposed to be the referee and if it was doing its job it would force the company to clean up its mess either by taxing it and giving the money to rivertown's Cleanup Crew or just regulating it and telling it to knock it off but suddenly sewage RS is using all of its profits to donate to the pro sewage politicians campaigns and buying Billboards that say sewer water is good for you actually and telling you that cleaning up the sewage would ruin the economy and you're right back where you started covered in now hypotheticals are fun and all but this is exactly why big polluters especially oil coal and gas companies are not being held accountable for the amount of damage they're doing to the climate the externalities in our economy are not being internalized now don't get me wrong we are making progress under our current system clean energy is getting cheaper countries are decarbonizing it's just not fast enough and it's blocked at every turn by polluting companies some economists argue that if we're really really going to tackle the climate crisis it's not enough to just regulate or tax a couple of companies or Industries we would have to change our economy so that it doesn't need to continue to grow and Gobble up more and more natural resources and pollute greenhouse gases every single year nothing grows forever some economists think that those of us who live in rich countries like Canada or the UK or the USA yeah suck at USA you're in third place now how's it feel we in rich countries already have enough stuff we are productive enough to provide for everyone's needs and we could actually make less stuff if we wanted to and lower our GDP as long as we distributed resources and money more equitably and efficiently this is called the degrowth movement and this might seem absolutely crazy what you want us to have less money what kind of economists are you but it turns out once countries get rich enough higher GDP per person stops corresponding to higher standards of living happiness and life satisfaction so it is theoretically possible for a rich country's people to live better even if the economy shrinks and produces less stuff under our current system of capitalism GDP the measure of all the stuff produced by an economy needs to increase every year or else you get a recession which means companies need to make more stuff every year how do you make more stuff by cutting down trees burning more oil mining more minerals and that means that the flip side of GDP growth is more emissions and more climate damage clean technology and energy exists and it can definitely help emissions stay the same or even go down as GDP goes up this has been done occasionally but usually usually higher GDP means more Productions means more emissions and climate damage globally the growth of emissions has slowed compared to the growth of GDP but it hasn't gone down so can we do capitalism without a constantly growing economy maybe there's a whole lot of disagreement some argue that maybe a reigned in government regulated version of capitalism can work some argue that we need to Pivot to some flavor of socialism and of course there are plenty of economists who think that we can continue growing the economy as long as that growth is green but even they think that we need to put significant restraints on big polluting companies they say that the problem isn't growth itself but maybe May it's just growth in all the wrong places like my face in high school maybe the problem is unequal growth or inequality another interesting little feature of global capitalism is that some people are filthy rich and some people are broke now we could argue for ours and I have about whether there is a right amount of inequality but I don't get invited to those sorts of parties anymore whether it's between individual people or countries the people who are most economically vulnerable will suffer the most from climate change and the rich will disproportionately make climate change worse cuz under the kind of capitalism we're doing right now the rich get richer and the Richer they get the more they supercharge climate change inequality makes climate change worse I mean it kind of makes sense middle class people take trains rich people take private planes Oxfam shows that the top 10% richest people cause half the climate change and also earn half the money in the world loads of Studies have found direct correlations between emissions and income inequality one study even showed that a 1% rise in inequality correlates with a 1.4% rise in emissions from electricity in buildings so good news bad news bad news is we can't just install a couple solar panels and keep the economy Trucking just the way that it is the good news is the way to effectively combat climate change through economics just so happens to improve most people's quality of life especially the part about decreasing wealth inequality when you look at the data the countries that have lower wealth inequality also have higher happiness scores and standards of living and they also often just so happen to have lower emissions so let's take a look at these Wonder countries and find out what we can learn from them so I looked at the rankings for the highest income equality the largest decrease in emissions or just the lowest emissions and the highest happiness scores and I found which countries all had that in common and oh would you look at that it's the Scandinavians and the Netherlands and New Zealand all these metrics happen to be biased towards Rich developed countries so I added a couple of countries that are developing but punching way above their weight class in all three of these metrics that is Uruguay Costa Rica and Bhutan these countries are all carbon neutral score very highly on happiness and life satisfaction indices and have fairly low inequality scores so what do they all have in common social safety nets Uruguay has a saying NAD is M NAD no nobody is better than anybody else so 90% of Uruguayan seniors have pensions the state provides cash transfers to low-income families and has strong Public Health Care and public education you also see this in the Nordic model Which prioritizes social safety nets and public services that anyone can access whether they're rich or poor all these Social Services decrease income inequality which we know means less emissions number two strong democracies in the US there's like two parties in the UK and Canada we technically have a few but like let's be real we have two in Sweden there's eight the reason Nordic countries can get away with this sort of half socialist half capitalist system is because so many people trust the government to regulate properly because they feel like their votes and their voices matter and number three strong commitments to get off fossil fuels in New Zealand 87% of electricity comes from clean energy now all of us can't be surrounded by an ocean to turn into Hydro power but every country has a unique opportunity for green energy generation New Zealand just happens to be smart enough to harness it and also they have a taxpayer funded TV show where comedians do spelling bees and if that's not an indication that their democracy rocks I don't know what is great gu but I'm so sorry that is a comma these countries all tax emissions incentivize clean energy and prioritize their citizens well-being their governments act as functioning referees to prevent unfettered capitalism and corporations from ruining the planet and you know their citizens lives but that's not what you asked me at the start of class you asked me whether we can solve climate change under capitalism and I'm not going to pretend to have an answer to that the truth is that none of us live under purely capitalist or purely socialist systems the economy is controlled by a mix of government and corporations and everybody else just in different amounts in different economies like I haven't even gotten to the fact that governments literally give taxpayer handouts to fossil fuel companies is that capitalism I haven't even mentioned that the climate crisis turbocharges inflation by destabilizing global trade and Supply chains can capitalism survive that the Wonder countries I mentioned earlier are certainly further to the Socialist side than most but they also just have well-functioning democracies that can pass smart policies and regulations it's true that the current system of capitalism that we have is not working for us but as we can see from the Wonder countries they all have elements of capitalism plus the government providing programs to reduce inequality acting as a referee to reduce externality caused by big polluting companies they have a lot of public participation and Trust in their governments so that big polluters can't just bribe their way into not being regulated their people are happy and their emissions are decreasing and that is not a coincidence so whether you overhaul the system completely or just modify things a little bit to be in line with the Wonder countries everybody agrees on a few things this economy isn't working for the planet and it's not working for everybody we need Global cooperation and smart policies that reign in the power of big polluting corporations while taking care of people and the planet governments around the world need stronger policies that protect people's well-being and the climate so what next well you can find out what those policies and solutions are and demand them from your government whether it's your city councelor or your prime minister and I just so happen to talk about those over on my channels plug now feel free to discuss quietly amongst yourselves but if you hey hey got the chatter out there hey all right that's it I'm telling Simon"
