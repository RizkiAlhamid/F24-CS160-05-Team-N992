      "transcript": "every four years Americans across this great nation put our differences aside to join hands and collectively lose our  minds over the presidential election turn out for what we think drun drun they're eating the dogs now we've seen some pretty crazy stuff in recent years but if you're thinking 2020 was the most Hog Wild election in modern history you have absolutely got to hear about what went down in the year 2000 cuz if you're some kind of rless jenzy damn daning shees Lord you may be surprised to hear that in the year 2000 there was a literal and verifiable stolen presidential election and even if you're over the age of 30 and maybe remember hearing something about hanging Chads and Florida recounts the details are certifiably insane and if nothing else it's good to just remind ourselves of the fragility of elections in the United States and why your vote Yes I'm talking to you really does matter in shaping the next four years and hell I'll say it I'm crazy maybe even Beyond hi I'm Raleigh Williams a guy with a climate science and policy degree and a raging obsession with an election that happened almost a quarter of a century ago and this is a video about stealing a presidential election welcome to climate town [Music] in the year 1999 a significant portion of the country genuinely believed that when the date rolled over from 99 to 00 all of our computers would self-destruct launch the nukes and Destroy America's economy it was called Y2K and it was a dumb thing to be afraid of but in their defense in 1999 computers looked like this [Music] but the New Year came and went and with Y2K safely in the rear view mirror Americans could focus on the two things that really mattered the hit single who Let The Dogs Out by the baham and who let the dogs out and the 2000 presidential election choose your character in the blue Corner was Al Gore he cut his teeth as a Democratic senator from Tennessee before becoming vice president to a saxophone toing sexual relations with that woman denying president by the name of Bill Clinton Gore released a bestselling book about global warming in the environment back here in 1992 he released the award-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth that supercharged climate change awareness here in 2006 but here in 2000 he's running for president today I announce that I am a candidate for president of the United States and in the Red Corner is George W bush not to be confused with his father and the president from eight years earlier George HW Bush George regular W Bush was a Texas oil man who founded an oil and gas exploration firm then became the co-owner of the Texas Rangers and then became the governor of Texas and in the year 2000 he's the Republican candidate for president we will renew America's purpose it's Gore versus Bush it's climate Guy versus Texas oilman it's election 2000 and it's right now the and if you're wondering why they're all so focused on a big big map it's because America doesn't have a simple democratic election where the candidate with the most votes wins we have the much stupider Electoral College where states are assigned Point values and each candidate tries to win the highest Stakes board game on earth and that means close elections can often come down to just a couple of states that could swing either way way but remember this is also a TV show which means networks are foaming at the mouth to call States as early and often as they can filling up the map and making politics feel like Wheel of Fortune George Bush he carries his home state of Texas Washington State goes for Gore Sarah you hit the jackpot with1 million and then at 7:49 p.m. eastern time NB BC felt they asked enough Floridians exiting the polls who they voted for and they were ready to make the call so sure interrupt you Mike you know I wouldn't do this if it weren't big Florida goes for Al Gore it was massive Florida had 25 electoral votes and if Gore took it the bush path to Victory looked rail thin the other networks followed suit and it seemed like a wrap then and there except it wasn't a wrap because as actual voting data replaced exit polling data Gore's lead began to shrink and something positively weird was going on because Florida polling stations were inundated with voters calling to say they were confused about the ballot and they were worried that their vote might have gone to the wrong person curious then 2 hours later at 9:55 p.m. NBC News is now taking Florida out of Vice President Gore's column and putting it back in the too close to call column as the other states fell into place only Florida was left undecided which means who ever won Florida would win the election then at 2:16 a.m. roughly 6 hours past their target demos bedtime Fox News Now projects George W bush the winner in Florida and thus it appears the winner of the presidency of the United States the other networks followed suit and Al Gore was left sitting in a hotel room staring at every major News Network in the country telling him he had lost an election that all the exit polling data said he had won so Al Gore picked up the phone called Bush to concede and then left left to go deliver the official concession speech the thing is Al Gore had not lost the presidential election yeah and he would have known that if he had thought to call his own numbers guy Michael hully who is keeping careful track of the Florida vote he said we're at the war memorial and I asked why and he said we're about to concede and I said for what we haven't lost the whole thing was a cluster in a number of ways but most importantly it was so close that it had automatically triggered Florida election code 102.1 141 legally requiring an automatic recount of all the votes in the state this election was not over but Al Gore didn't know that and was literally walking to the stage to concede the election when his senior adviser David Morehouse ran his ass down and stopped him the drama imagine that moment I wish I had a clip of it I don't but I super wish I did luckily HBO made a made for TV movie about the 2000 election and it did include this goofy ass reenactment no no no Mr vice president Mr vice president Mr vice president Mr vice president Mr Vice President sir I'm not going to keep please please Mr Vice President there's a problem with the numbers in Florida and then in the most awkward phone call of his entire life Gore called Bush back to UNC concede as you can imagine Bush was pretty pissed the conversation got heated and Gore apparently ended the call with something to the effect of I don't care what your little brother says this isn't over and that's a pretty badass thing to say it's also a little confusing but in this case it makes perfect sense because George Bush's little brother is Jeb Bush and in the year 2000 Jeb Bush was the governor of Florida I told my brother that we were going to carry Florida for him is that going to be a truthful statement it better be so the race moved to the Sunshine State where the 5.8 million votes cast in Florida would be machine recounted to see if Bush's 1,784 vote lead would hold and as the computers rescanned the votes Bush's lead steadily shrank down to just 327 votes but that's not all there were an additional 171,000 ballots that the machines had just skipped because either they couldn't read any Vote or they read multiple votes which makes sense if you remember the many many many calls on election day about confusing ballots and defective equipment these are the same computers that we thought might fire nuclear weapons at Russia if they weren't sure what year it was good thing Florida state law says we'll take these 171,000 ballots and recount them by hand right Florida law and the law in many other states calls for a careful check by real people of the machine results in elections like this one but team bush had a slightly different take they wanted to not count any more votes and declare George Bush president immediately and in situations like this you'd hope there'd be someone to step in and say get we're counting all the votes I'd even settle for a simple sorry but counting votes is how democracy worked and that person should have been Florida Secretary of State C Harris now in a wild coincidence the co-chair of George Bush's Florida presidential campaign was also a woman named Catherine Harris and in an even Wilder coincidence it was the same person that's right both the Florida governor and the Secretary of State in charge of maintaining the Integrity of the election had actively campaigned for George Bush which is a really hard position to be in if your Al Gore luckily he did have one thing going for him he got more votes in Florida than George Bush did that's right we now know for sure that Gore got more votes in Florida than Bush by kind of a lot unfortunately some serious problems with Florida's voting system invalidated literally thousands of ballots that would have gone for Gore [Music] good God people this election is a mess first off thousands of Voters across the whole state of Florida showed up to the polls and found they're not allowed to vote that's right newly elected governor and longtime little brother Jeb Bush oversaw a purge of the voter roles that accidentally included a lot of legal voters who overwhelmingly voted to the Democratic he looked at the role and he looked at me and he said we have a problem you're not on the rooll sorry about that now down here in Palm Beach County they used a ballot with such bad graphic design that thousands of democratic Jewish voters accidentally voted for the alt-right anti-semitic candidate Pat Buchanan the Democrats were listed second I punched the second hole and that second hole was for Pat buan and this is not just like my opinion man here's Pat Buchan himself if the two candidates they pushed were Buchanan and Gore almost certainly those are Al Gore's votes and not mine and as if printing your ballots on a bunch of godamn origami cranes isn't bad enough voters up here in Duval County were instructed to vote on every page of their ballot but anyone who followed those instructions had their vote invalidated cuz there were two pages of presidential candidates and these aren't just like a couple of votes in Florida there was a vote for Gore on 84,000 of these invalid multiv vote ballots compared to just 37,000 multiv vote ballots that included Bush but the bush legal team was prepared to swear on their mother's lives that a bunch of elderly Jewish Democrats had voted alt-right and that the multie ballots were uncountable because technically there's no way to tell for sure who the voter was trying to vote for not even if the candidates were Al Gore and also popular writing candidate Al Gore you want to be ideologically pure do you want to win they said we want to win and under the time pressure there seemed to be no practical way for the gore legal team to contest any of those multiv votes The Accidental Buchanan votes or The Purge votes that's thousands of votes Flushed Away man but wait because there was a ballot issue that they could go after in some counties voters have to punch out little paper Circle known as Chads it sounds simple but sometimes that Chad hangs on for dear life and other times that Chad recepticle fills up so godamn full that you can't punch yours out at all now you got yourself one of the thousands of pregnant or dimpled Chad ballots that never got counted but since these Chad stricken no votes could indicate just one candidate the gore team set their sights on hand recounting ballots with pregnant or dimpled or swinging Chads and in doing so though ushered in a dynasty of just the absolute hacki as talk show jokes I had to go to the doctor today you know why I have a hanging chad and so the entire 2000 presidential election basically came down to 61,000 ballots in Florida that machines thought were blank would they be counted or would they be thrown away we'll find out next time just kidding let's find out right now the gore team struck first by requesting recounts in just four heavily Democrat counties where they thought they'd uncover a boatload of dimpled and hanging chad ballots with Al Gore's name all over them the bush team immediately sued to stop the hand recounts on the grounds that Gore was selecting favorable counties Gore counters in a televised address I am also prepared if Governor Bush prefers to include in this recount all the counties in the entire State of Florida Bush ignores the offer and doubles down in the lawsuit to stop the four recounts but loses the case and the recounts Are a Go Point Gore but the bush bench is deep they had to let the recounts start but no one said they had to let it finish so Secretary of State and team Bush MVP Katherine Harris tightened the recount deadline and Republicans worked to slow down the actual vote counting itself they argued over every vote vote for six Republican party challenges four more votes for Gore election supervisor Jane Carroll a Republican voted against this count they had to shut down the accounting temporarily because the canvasing board members had to run to court to go appear before the judge to talk about whether or not we were eating Chads Katherine Harris then attempted to stop the entire hand recount early I've decided it is my duty under Florida law to exercise my discretion in denying these requested amendments but was denied by the Florida Supreme Court undeterred Katherine Harris follows up by stating she won't accept any recounts unless they're completely finished in the next 3 days the gore legal team says hey you can't do that and the Florida Supreme Court steps in and says stop  around and gives them a week to do the recount there was only one question left on everybody's mind who let the dog sorry no who would win this election with the recount in full swing things looked very good for Gore he picked up 93 new votes in vucha county and if their projections were right Gore would win another 3 to 400 votes in Palm Beach another 100 in Miami Dade and up to 500 in Broward County even on the low side that would be enough to put Al Gore right back on top pretty good news for the Democrats the Republicans on the other hand weren't about to let a lead slip away they devised a new method to ensure none of those votes got counted in Miami dat a young Roger Stone had teamed up with other Republican operatives and while the hand recount was happening on the 18th floor of the Clark Center building a hoorde of what appeared to be angry Floridian protesters stor wared the building stop the count stop the fraud an instant Classic this horde of men in suits banging on Windows and attempting to disrupt an American presidential election would become known as the Brooks Brothers riot after one of Gore's lawyers was chased down and harassed for the crime of having a sample ballot in his hand the Miami dat canvasing board felt sufficient threatened and they had had enough they stopped the recount and if you're wondering if this was a spontaneous bunch of protesters or some kind of group of Republican operatives trying to steal an election for their team here's a picture I think can really answer that [Music] question no recount means no change in votes from Miami dat but sure the Palm Beach County votes could go Gore's way right yeah they could have if they had finished the recount but since Katherine Harris was Secretary of State she was able to move the Palm Beach County deadline up a day to the Sunday after Thanksgiving um so the secretary of state has apparently decided to shut us down with approximately 2 hours perhaps left to go um and that's how she chose to exercise her discretion we believe there are approximately 800 to 1,000 ballots left to come um so unfortunately um at this time we have no other choice but then to shut down the supervisor for elections needs to uh hurriedly uh gather all the paperwork and prepare to file the returns that we have um we certainly don't want to get anything in there at 501 Palm Beach submitted a partial recount and Katherine Harris gave me old two for flinching and rejected it for being incomplete once again Al Gore would get none of the newly counted votes and it looked like this whole refusing to count votes in a democratic election was a real winning strategy for team Bush I hereby declare Governor George W bush the winner of Florida's 25 electoral votes for the president of the United States but not so fast Jackson cuz team Gore knows how to play the hits they filed yet another lawsuit and the Florida Supreme Court decided that they weren't going to let a bunch of computers that looked like this and George Bush's two best friends decide who got to be president Court shall order a manual recount of all undervotes in any Florida county where such a recount has not yet occurred the Florida Supreme court ordered a hand recount of the entire State cuz they weren't about to let Florida be the butt of everybody's jokes for the next 24 [Music] years that's right it's the Supreme Court of the United States and under the flimsiest of legal pretext they've decided to take Bush's case rather than let Florida complete a legally mandated hand recount of their own votes the five Republican appointed conservative justices closed ranks and voted five to four to stop the count and end the election officially handing the presidency to the guy who both lost the popular vote and received fewer votes in the deciding State five to four huh so you do understand democracy and as if to admit that they shouldn't have stepped in to subvert an election the five conservative majority Supreme Court ruled for possibly the first and only time that this decision was not precedent it would only apply in this one case so let's all just forget about the time a conservative Supreme Court stepped in and stopped an election that was actively counting votes and handed it to the Republican and there have been some incredible think pieces written about this whole Affair but possibly the best quote comes from the dissenting opinion of Justice John Paul Stevens although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election the identity of the loser is perfectly clear it is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law and that is how the US Presidency ended up in George regular W Bush's hands in the year 2000 honestly it's a pretty depressing story and you might even be wondering why I decided to cover it well here's the thing it's a presidential election year once again you probably wish it wasn't and after hearing me smash through all the ways the 2000 election got absolutely borked by some little brothers and a bunch of the guys from that scene in Wolf of Wall Street you might even find yourself thinking what's the point in voting when these dudes can just come in and swipe an election but here's how I see it the biggest problem with the 2000 election was that it was too godamn close sure this kind of thing is exciting as hell is this the dagger but this is the election for the president of the United States and when we're trying to finally double down on the biggest pieces of climate legislation ever we don't want a buzzer beater we want to win by 40 we want a blowout we want to light the scoreboard up so hot it becomes self-aware like in the movie Space Jam but I'm not out here trying to advocate for voting for the climate on Vibes alone baby so we teamed up with our friends over at Evergreen action to take a look at what the actual climate Stakes of this election are and why you getting yourself registered to vote and then actually going to the polls is 100% worth your time now obviously I cannot predict the future if I could I wouldn't be making YouTube videos I would be out predicting I don't know what it would be but I know I would get it right but thanks to the predictive modeling of a nonpartisan energy and environmental policy firm called Energy innovation we can get a pretty good approximation of what our climate future might look like here's their projection of greenhouse gas emissions in the US based on three scenarios in Gray we have a business as usual model that takes into account the federal policies we've currently got in place such as the inflation reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law as well as energy Trends and Technology costs notice the general downward trend of the line that kind of levels off around 2035 now let's take a look at another line This orange line is the emissions projection for the climate and energy policy recommendations from Project 2025 if you've never heard of it project 2025 is a sort of policy playbook for a potential Republican president in this case one Donald Trump it was spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation and about a hundred other mainstream conservative organizations and it contains a ton of specific climate and energy policy goals that energy Innovation was able to plug into their model to get a pretty scary look at an American future under project 2025 it includes stuff like increasing liquefied natural gas capacity increasing crude oil production repealing the inflation reduction Act and the infrastructure law that kind of thing now this may just look like another regular old line but energy Innovation projects that path would dump billions more tons of carbon dioxide into the air which would lead to some pretty disastrous climate outcomes not to mention the Litany of other problems that come from burning tons of fossil fuels it's been you looked at me project 2020 5 has been getting a lot of press lately mostly because it feels like conservative groups are finally saying the quiet part out loud and it's freaking a lot of people out project 2025 advocates for things like unchecked Presidential Power the elimination of the Department of Education a gutting of the EPA and of course a desire to how do they phrase it if the American people elect a conservative president his administration will have to eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere after all that came out project 2025 became a bit of a political liability that Trump has tried to distance himself from I don't even know those guys but I'm pretty confident we can use the policy recommendations in Project 2025 a document specifically crafted for Donald Trump by the Heritage Foundation as a pretty good approximation of what another Trump White House could look like because roll the clip the critical job of Institutions such as heritages to lay the groundwork and Heritage does such an incredible job at that encourage new thinking Embrace new directions and keep Heritage at the Vanguard of the conservative movement I think tremendous things are going to be coming out of Heritage and there's also this Heritage Foundation president somebody else doing an unbelievable job and of course who could forget his comprehensive energy policy plan we will drill baby drill yeah but there's also a third line and fortunately for us it's one we can actually get excited about because of a president came into office and oh I don't know actually tried to be a climate Leader by enacting the kinds of policies that Evergreen action has been nice enough to jot down in their Evergreen action plan 2.0 we could get this third line a deep sultry Blue Line a line that gets all the way down to Net Zero by 2050 I mean good God that's a nice looking line but what can we do to make our reality look more like that really nice line great question we take sweet sweet action we build a clean and effective National power grid we decarbonize the industrial sector we modernize and Electrify our transportation systems we Electrify our homes and commercial buildings we make polluters pay for the extensively documented messes they've left behind and more and this is one of those scenarios where you don't even have to care about climate change to benefit being a climate leader means leaning way into a clean energy transition we'd be building out every part of an updated clean energy system and that means a  ton of skilled well-paid union jobs renovating and strengthening the grid improving our public transportation networks building out electric vehicle charging infrastructure generating clean energy The Works we're also looking at lowering overall energy costs as better power generation Tech comes online and phases out the current technology of light things on fire or smash them till they explode Believe It or Not hauling ass towards a clean energy revolution could actually save Americans money on their monthly energy bills according to energy Innovation enacting an evergreen action plan 2.0 style policy could save the average household almost $300 a year by 2030 compared to the project 2025 plan being a climate leader is also about rebuilding and strengthening underserved and unders supported communities with worker and Community programs it's also about holding fossil fuel companies accountable for making a big mess and then not cleaning it up and all of this is only possible if we elect a president who's going to push for climate action by enacting bold climate policy like a national clean energy standard and investing in clean American industry and we're definitely not going to get anywhere near net Zer by 2050 if our main plan to deal with climate change is to just eradicate climate change referen from absolutely everywhere but the cool part is if we get this right it could go really great we could actually build the future that people are excited about we've all heard of horrifying tipping points that lead to climate catastrophe but there are also positive tipping points caused by proactive climate action the right mix of policy Solutions can align climate the economy environmental justice and labor incentives and cause massive decarbonization through the rare and coveted spiral into control and look I wish we had another 4 years to burn before we need to get moving okay I wish we didn't have yet another most important election of Our Generation but we do because 2050 is really fuing close to give you a sense of how close it is Who Let the Dogs Out by the Baja men was released in the year 2000 that's 24 years ago that means we basically got one more who let the dogs out before it's 2050 so if you're sufficient bought in which I think is a reasonable assumption considering you just listen to two dozen minutes of me yell at you about hanging Chads in the electoral process it is critically important that you get yourself registered to vote and that you vote and when I say vote I mean vote for kamla Harris and Tim Walls that's right I Raleigh Williams a guy with a YouTube channel called climate Town who has a master's degree in climate science and policy I'm officially in favor of the candidate who might actually do something about the climate crisis and honestly I kind of make it a point not to get too endorse in these videos but the guy thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax to stop American manufacturing and I am not saying that a comma Harris presidency would be a lock to get to net0 by 2050 it's still going to take a ton of work but with some good luck some good policy and some good advocacy we could have an actual good shot at some genuine crisis averting climate action and if you want to do something right now you can make sure you are registered to vote different states have different registration deadlines so it would be extremely Raven of you to go check your voter registration status online click the link down in the description to see if you're registered to vote already and if you're not register right there congratulations and now you can lean into this doing your whole civic duty Thing by checking out the Playbook that our friends over at climate change makers put together one shockingly effective strategy is handwriting nonpar in letters and sending them to voters in swing states with a vote forward campaign if you're curious check them out Link in the description but whatever you do just make sure you've got a plan to actually pull the lever or punch the hole or fold the origami or whatever okay we're voting climate up and down the ballot bring some friends with you make a whole trip out of it okay let's vote so hard that we win by 40 because the closer it is the more chance these people get to decide who gets to be president all the more reason to carefully and as a group vote for the climate I'll leave that up to you to determine what I'm just kidding that means to vote Harris walls obviously obviously okay that's the end of the episode thank you so much for watching if you liked it smash that like button destroy the comment section and put the Subscribe button in the trunk of an old car and roll it into a lake and hit that little bell icon too if you like what you saw and you want to support us the best way to do that is through our patreon page we just revamped it we got a gaggle of behind the scenes footage we do Town Halls episode q&as and even access to the climate Town land line that's this phone that gets actual phone calls sometimes patrons will call in to try to leave a message and suddenly find themselves talking to me because I picked up and now we're both wondering was this really the best use of both of our time so if that sounds like fun to you join the patreon page pitch over all right big thanks to our partners over at Evergreen action check out their Evergreen action plan 2.0 using the link in the bio get that PDF and go to town on those details and a special thank you to Ben Phil and Kylie over at ethic for letting us use their green screen for that Jim Kramer Mad Money election bit that we did you remember that it pretty fun lot of shouting we've also got some great t-shirts and a podcast and a newsletter and a Discord server and we linked them all in the description check them out and let me know what you think call me even I'll be right here we did it y'all check right now to see if you registered to vote seriously do it right now love you okay okay I have not tried marijuana uh I have never used it at any time [Music]

      "published_at": "2024-08-14T16:30:08Z",
      "transcript": "hey I'm here in Los Angeles California it's a City full of people who are way hotter than me but they're almost all dead inside it's in the eyes there's just nothing in there not unlike the LA River it's a Bonafide movie star but it's polluted to the core from Decades of chemical spills pesticide infused runoff and the burned out rubber from 95 takes of this scene from Greece but if you're not from Los Angeles you might find yourself thinking that doesn't look like a river at all this is a river this is a river river dog River but out here in the American West a historic drought has made it very hard for these lifeless hotties to remember that this is almost no water at all and it's not just Californians the more than 40 million people in the American West served by the famously overused Colorado River are being asked to conserve this water by any means necessary historic water cuts to multiple States shutting off the water while you're brushing your teeth taking shorter showers cut back on their water use beinging in the shower that's going to save you a couple of plushes and save you a couple of gallons get a weapon and fire it into your lawn but no matter how much water they conserve there's not enough to go around so where is all the water going well if you look at the 1.9 trillion gallons of Colorado River water consumed by people every year a very unfortunate Trend occurs according to a study from 2020 all the water people use for drinking swimming pools watering their lawns slip and slides and any other private consumption accounts for just 12% of the water use golf courses office parks and all other businesses are just 4% of water use and weighing in at 79% of all the water we use is agriculture which is crops and that might make sense if it was crops for people but the vast majority of water we use in the American West goes to grow food that people do not eat 56% of all the water in this river goes to animal Agriculture and one animal above all others so who's taking all of America's water the cow not this cow in particular but the United States is home to 87.2 million cows and the food those cows eat requires so much water it's creating a real ship storm for people who want that water for drinking running cities making energy basically just stuff we need to do to live and it would be one thing if we were blasting through our water supply because the citizens of our great nation decided that's how they wanted to use it but the rules for who goes thirsty and who gets to flood a literal desert were written over a hundred years ago and are based entirely on the unbreakable Ironclad law of dibs they consider dibs so sacred that a single family in California whose grandfather happened to start a dairy farm near Palm Springs in the 1920s gets more water than the entire city of Las Vegas the people in this part of California get more Colorado River water than all of Arizona and Nevada combined and if that sounds like a stupid way to manage a critical resource just wait until you hear about the foreign governments Who currently have the right to use an unlimited amount of groundwater from America's deserts and are exercising that right to send cow food back to their own deserts so as our supply of water is being decreased by climate change which it very much is and our demand for water is being increased by a growing population of both people and livestock we should probably find a way to be a little more efficient with our water use and regardless of your feeling on cheeseburgers I think we can all agree that it's generally a good practice to just pop the hood on how we're using one of our most critical resources to see if there's anything that can be learned from it hi I'm Raleigh Williams a guy with a climate science and policy degree a little Sparkle in my eye and what I can only imagine is foot conjunctivitis and this is a video about who's taking all of America's water welcome to climate [Music] town to understand why we're so hellbent on growing animal food in America's deserts we got to go back to the thrilling conclusion of the Civil War the US had just been hot glued back together and people were free to enjoy their beloved pastimes of making horses run fast honky baseball and uprooting the entire family and building a new life somewhere else but where to go well what about this part I mean why the hell does nobody live there besides the people who already live there but I'm sure they'll move so the US hired a guy named John Wesley Powell to do a Geological Survey and they crossed their fingers hoping Powell would come back saying there's a ton of water everywhere and everything's ready to pump and grow Powell spent two decades studying the Colorado River and the West overall and then came back to Congress in 1890 with this Ripper of a map truly look at this map beautiful colors incredible detail and the breakdown of the watersheds imagine trying to make this map with without computers or satellites or colored pencils it would be per near impossible unfortunately Powell found that there was just not enough water to settle the west and if you wanted to get even a few people out there it would make more sense to create Federal dams to stabilized water access and to Define your political boundaries by water flow regions instead of by arbitrary state lines you know cuz water is such a critical foundation for life and all the indigenous people who already lived there knew that and had extremely effective water conservation techniques dating back to 10,000 BC including sometimes being nomadic because water comes and goes in the west and you need to be able to follow it unfortunately that wasn't really going to fly with the settlers who preferred to get hundreds of Acres of their own private land that no one else can touch and you can't tell me there's not unlimited water for my free land and as you can probably imagine the US government didn't listen to a single one of Powell's warnings and just wait saved settlers West like a third base coach in an exciting game of honky baseball too soon for a call back I just said honky baseball you know what cut this part and if you're watching this and you're thinking well obviously this John Wesley Powell guy didn't know what the fck he was talking about because I've got a cousin in Arizona and they have a swimming pool in their backyard that's a reasonable thing to think but first consider the phrase credit card debt and let's keep going among the places settlers flocked to was just the straight up desert including the bone dry Imperial Valley California which gets just 3 Ines of rain on average per year and has more sun in the winter than any other place in the US it's also in the movies that's what you get Welcome To Earth up until 1901 the Imperial Valley was a Barren uninhabited place because fing of course it was it was the desert but nowadays it looks like this it's been one week you looked at me that's because the US dug a canal to divert water from the Colorado River into the south side of the Valley and the Imperial Valley was not alone the US government damned and canaled and borrowed whatever they wanted from the mighty Colorado to suit the needs of the settlers who wanted that water and since water was the single most important resource for these thirsty Western settlers they made it their absolute beeswax to dibs as much water as humanly possible after all this is free water you get the rights to Forever you would have to be an idiot not to try to get as much as you possibly could and so a dibson spree for the Colorado River commenced Farmers got a couple million gallons a year here a couple million gallons a year there but I mean there's two trillion gallons of usable water in that son of a how could we possibly run out of water he asked less than halfway into a 30 minute long video yes I am hopeful for one of our favorite Publications Grist did some excellent reporting on this link in the bio and found this quote from a 1960 US Supreme Court case I am morally certain that neither in my lifetime nor in your lifetime nor the lifetime of your children and great-grandchildren will there be an inadequate supply of water as the population of California exploded the other Western States got scared that Golden State farmers would would dibs too hard and take all the water this is kind of a legitimate concern because the law of the river stipulated water was allocated based on first in time first in right and California was about to call shotgun on all the water before they'd even seen the car which is not allowed California you have to be able to see the car it just makes it more fair but instead of deciding on some kind of equal distribution mechanism the western states double down on the dib system with a nationally sanctioned dibs in 1922 Colorado Arizona California Nevada Utah Wyoming and New Mexico sat down with Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover and hammered out a deal that would split the river in half hamburger style giving upper Basin States 7.5 million acre feet per year and lower Basin State at 7.5 million acre feet per year now I know you know obviously but an acre foot is the amount of water it takes to submerge one acre or about 3/4 of a football field in one foot of water so you know kind of a lot of water an acre foot is about 325,000 gallons of water and the Colorado River compact do out 15 million of these little guys to the seven states sounds great one problem the Colorado River does not have that much water they drew up the Colorado River compact during some extremely wet years and despite knowing there were only 14 million acre feet or less for consumption they figured it would just be a problem for future American to deal with thanks guys they also completely cut Mexico out of the initial compact only to attack them on later by inventing a bunch of water that didn't really exist and also also they didn't even pretend to equitably include indigenous people but you probably already guessed that didn't you oh and another problem water rights are hierarchical which means senior rights holders get their entire allotment before Junior rights holders even get a drop and even if senior rights holders wanted to conserve water and send the rest down the line they kind of can't because water rights are subject to a use it or lose it rule see in an attempt to prevent people from dibsy a bunch of water only to turn around and sell it to the highest bidder you'd only get to keep the rights to water that you actually used and if you think about this for an extra 10 seconds you realize it's an excellent way to discourage water conservation if a farmer decides to use less water or develop a less wasteful irrigation technique that farmer is rewarded with having all of his extra water taken away forever ah you thought I wasted that water uh-uh bucket try to keep up anyway farmers were also banned from selling their unused water allotment as part of the government's attempt to avoid water speculators so if your dad's dad moved to the desert and called dibs at the exact right time your family might Now find itself with 84 billion gallons of water every year and a strong in incentive to use every last drop and it is this little quirk in America's water law that got so many desert dwelling Farmers into the cattle feed business that's right it's time to talk about Alfalfa Alfalfa is prized for having a lot of easily digestible protein and if you're trying to support a dairy cow blasting out hot high protein milk it's a damn fine option for feed beef cows tend to eat a lot of other stuff but they'll also suck down Alfalfa with the best of them when they get a crack at that good green before researching for this video all my Alp Alpha knowledge was about this little but I've pushed all that information out to make room for this Alfalfa now it's your problem as a crop Alfalfa fuing loves the Sun and can grow for 5 to 7 years with way deeper Roots than normal row crops also if you can keep the sun shining on it year round you can get 10 to 12 harvests per year out of the same plant but unfortunately Alfalfa also needs a lot lot of water so you're probably thinking this is one of those classic trade-offs Ratatouille loves to cook but he's got to be sneaky about it or else his little rat will get shot alphaalpha loves the blasting Sun but it's got to be sopping wet basically all the time so you got to compromise right wrong yes Alfalfa is also grown in other less Aid parts of the US but those places are nothing compared to the yields you can get if you have two ingredients a full-on blasting Desert Sun year round and a ridiculous amount of water that you have to use they have so much water in that part of the desert that a lot of alphalpha fields have traditionally been flood irrigated which conveniently for us is exactly what it sounds like you hook up a hose and make a fun little flood for your crop friends until they're soaking in an inch or two of water some of that water goes into the soil some floats up into the air and some runs off into another Farm or maybe all the way to the salt and sea a body of water filled almost entire irely with excess irrigation water from the Colorado River and by the way we're currently out on a farm in Long Island this is not the kind of farming we're talking about in the video we mostly just wanted like a farmy kind of background so that it wouldn't bump too much with the other parts of the video this is a place called Young's Farm they do excellent work here thank you so much for the location now pretend you're back in the American West another benefit of alphalpha is it can be grown year round alongside potentially higher value seasonal crops got a couple extra acres and a bunch of water to use blast them Jackson Alfalfa can also withstand short periods of no irrigation then pop right back so you could drop the water demand in the summer then bring back the same stand of alphalpha into production when there's more water available it's honestly a pretty good crop it just requires a  ton of water and uh not to ride his coattails too hard or anything but my main man John Oliver did a whole Last Week Tonight about water a couple of years ago and found this excellent clip from an Arizona alphaalpha farmer interview roll the clip of them rolling the clip just listen to this farmer in Arizona explaining why he chose to grow a particularly water intensive crop well I just been farming it this Alpha alha you got to keep farming it to keep the water and that's why I was mainly doing it was to hang on to the water in the Imperial Valley alone alphalpha fever has led to the projected use of 2.6 million acre feet of water from the Colorado River this year and according to reporting from propublica in the Desert Sun most of that water apparently goes to just 20 families in the valley who have such senior water rights that they aren't subject to the same constraints as nearby cities propublica and the Desert Sun even made some excellent Graphics about it and here they are right now that's just one section of the Colorado River if you look at the upper part of the river that includes Colorado New Mexico Utah and the one with the hor Show everybody's parents are obsessed with that land is mine you see that fence that's mine that fence is mine this feels mine that fence down there that's mine too spinning some B and in that region 90% of agricultural water is turned into cattle feed I'm sweating into my own eyeballs yes we do feed some cows for fun sure but the vast majority are fed so they can either blast out milk or be mysteriously killed and turned into beef and I know it seems like treating an important resource like it's worth nothing and will never run out seems like a strategy that wouldn't have a downside but folks it has a downside as the population and farming operations grow and they're removing more and more water for showering drinking and growing crops in the desert we started writing checks that our asses couldn't cash and we simply do not have the water for the activities we want to use it for the Colorado River and its reservoirs have dwindled to alarmingly low levels St George Utah is running out of water Dry River beds depleted reservoirs canals and fow fields and also climate change has snuck into the party and is making everything worse in the back near the bathroom the worst Mega drought in at least 12200 years yeah they say climate change has fueled wildfires and threatened the economic security of farmers it's endangering the security of ener and Water Resources for nearly 6 million homes and businesses across seven states one study from UCLA found that Rising temperatures between 200000 in 2021 have led to a loss of 30 million acre feet of water from the Colorado River Basin which has combined with the drought which is also probably tied to climate change to leave the massive reservoirs along the Colorado dangerously historically low the reservoirs are so low that even a massive smash of snow pack over a winter or two doesn't come close to refilling the reserves which means this may not be an example of a classic drought this might be aridification while a drought is temporary and we'd expect a full rebound aridification means the area will be permanently drier with less water available and while the American West is particularly susceptible to a drought we certainly don't have a monopoly on it and I don't want to hit you over the head with it but that means that the climate might be changing which means climate change I'll say it I'm crazy I'll say climate change right to your dang face I'll say it at dinner right to my uncle and we won't talk for 6 years but if the Colorado River water rights are too complicated the federal rules around how much groundwater you can pump out of private Wells are a whole lot simpler there aren't any groundwater is water that collects in giant underground aquifers over the course of hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions of years regulation of groundwater is usually left up to the States but they tend to be pretty loose with the laws and that's not me editorializing States like Missouri literally brag about having quote the loosest water laws in the country where water users have the right to under most circumstances use as much water as they would like and for whatever purpose they see fit back in the Civil War days when honky baseball was already starting to get boring great call back yes the government didn't really understand how or why groundwater flowed in in modern days we Now understand that aquafers take thousands of years to recharge but back then we thought it was maybe unlimited Infinity water I mean it didn't even matter at the time because groundwater was dozens to thousands of feet below the surface why make a law about water that we didn't even have the technology to get to by the 1930s our craftiest Engineers had figured out how to drill down and pump it out but instead of making laws to regulate it we had already established the sort of no shirt no shoes no problem policy and to this day groundwater is free and Unlimited in most places one of those places is most of Arizona where you are free to pump as much water as you like out of their underground aquifers which are doing just fine I'm sorry I'm hearing that should be declining at an alarming rate and it's here that we get a sense of just how little of a America gives about its water because what do you think happens when you pump too much water out of an aquafer uh-oh did you just Google it cuz that's cheating and cheaters never win but also if you went online to find a news article about groundwater you may have found more than you barging for that's right I'm talking about bias lucky for you there's ground news yes sir ground news is an independent website and app that gives you an easier and more data- driven way to read your news every story comes with a visual breakdown of the publication political leaning reporting reliability and ownership allowing you to see potential journalistic conflicts before you're telling a room full of people that Rudy Giuliani can do a kickflip you want an example yeah I bet you do did you know that the Oklahoma State superintendent just mandated that the Bible must be incorporated into public schools for kids from fifth grade all the way through graduation let's check it out right away you can see that over 150 news outlets reported on the story of these 25% lean left while only 19% lean right huh you can also compare headlines to see how bias can affect framing the Western Journal frames this as Oklahoma righteously putting the Bible back in schools while National zero focuses on the Oklahoma education secretary threatening to revoke teaching licenses for not incorporating the Bible different ground news also has my personal favorite feature the blind spot feed where you can see stories that the Publications you usually read might not cover did you hear about the Pope new swimming pool not that but you know stuff like that you got to check it out for yourself ground news helps you think more critically about how news is spreading and who's probably reading it which helps you better understand our increasingly divisive world and that sounds pretty damn good to me and if you're thinking what I'm thinking I encourage you to check out ground news and yeah baby we got a discount code for you I'm talking ground. news/ I think back slash but I've never really been able to tell the difference climate Town that's the important part ground. newclimate toown or just click that link in the description and get 40% off the Vantage level subscription which gives you access to every single goddamn feature on the app that's $4.99 N5 a month which has a well-known $5 a month bias thank you and now back to climate town and the thrilling answer to the question what do you think happens if you pump two much groundwater out of an aquafer you run out of water and it doesn't come back the more water you pump out of the ground the lower and lower the water table gets this leads to a phenomenon called subsidence where land slowly caves in hellmouth style the more you pump the deeper you have to drill your well until eventually you run out of water it's a lot like putting all your bills on a credit card it feels incredible for a while but sooner or later it's going to catch up with you and the way I know this is because it's happening right now in Arizona people in laaz County Arizona who used to have functioning groundwater Wells are waking up to find that they now have a very deep very dry pipe in their yard because let me tell you about the AL marai Dairy from Saudi Arabia as of 2018 it has been illegal to grow Al Alpha in Saudi Arabia without getting too far into it Saudi Arabia pumped the out of their groundwater from the late 1940s until a couple of years ago and in that time they used up Approximately 80% of their fossil groundwater they needed to look elsewhere for the most precious of resources and due to the United States's loose groundwater laws that meant buying land in Arizona and just taking America's ground waterer so they bought 15 square miles of prime Arizona desert drilled deeper in the aquafer than the tyes and farmers in the county and dangerously lowered the groundwater level by pumping up as much water as they wanted for Z Freedom it would seem is free and if you're wondering how much water Saudi Arabia pulled out of the ground you're not alone the Arizona state land Department sent a memo to at least ask them to measure how much water was getting pumped out because they were worried about groundwater depletion as a result of agricultural leases in the butler Valley but unfortunately the Arizona state government at the time wanted to be cautious of tangling with a powerful company and the metering request was denied but I mean come on how much water could Saudi Arabia possibly have taken and I don't presume to know how the people of laaz County Arizona feel about this but luckily I don't have to because there's a recording of them explicitly saying how they feel about this thanks to the top tier journalism by a publication called reveal you're saying it's perfectly legal for these people to come in here drain the aquafer and the local people have to redrill their Wells that they've lived there for years we got to move on but yes it is it they're not breaking the law now Saudi Arabia shipping alphalpha back home sounds pretty bad until you remember that the number one exporter of alphalpha with more exports than all other countries in the world combined yes it's the United States it's not always the United States in sentences like that but like nine times out of 10 it is and yes a ton of those exports come from the most water constrained parts of the Colorado River Basin you want to hear something really wild in the Imperial Valley after they harvest that flood irrigated alphalpha for the 12th time that year 12th lft that's a obstacle course of a word whatever it's more expensive to send that alphaalpha to cows in another part of California than it is to cram it onto a cargo ship and send it off to two of the biggest alphaalpha importers in the world China and Japan and if you're wondering how that could possibly be cheaper here's a fun little factoid you can tell your friends the US Imports more stuff from China than we export so there's a constant stream of shipping containers Coming to America full and going back empty China and Japan are eating an increasing amount of beef and dairy but rather than use their own precious Water Resources they can buy and ship American livestock feed like Alfalfa across the Pacific for next to nothing cramming those otherwise empty cargo ships full to the brim with compressed alphaalpha hay and I don't want to be overly dramatic but this basically amounts to exporting water water that we apparently really need in the Arid West and I'm not being overly dramatic because this is exactly what a bunch of much smarter and more informed people than me have already said I'm just saying it way louder than them also big shout out to Arizona Water expert Professor Robert Glennon for all the help he gave us on this episode he wrote this incredible book unquenchable you should totally read it Link in the bio as well as a bunch of other articles and another book how many books have you written is it zero books would zero be an accurate count I I'm sorry I don't know where that came from I think this son is permanently cooking my brain uh let's wrap this up the United States is currently in the middle of a serious Water Crisis that we are treating very UNS seriously we haven't updated our Western water laws that we cobbled together to help 1900 era Farmers settle water disputes without shooting each other and now those laws have metastasized our available river water is decreasing due to climate change but rather than reward conservation we're incentivizing Farmers to use all the water they possibly can our groundwater is being pumped out faster than it can be replenished but rather than regulated or even measure it we're giving it away for free with a purchase of a little bit of land our credit card debt is coming due and our reaction is to continue spending so what are we going to do about it well step one is to stop incentivizing the misuse of water and in some ways this is already starting to happen Arizona governor Katie Hobbs has canel one of the leases Saudi Arabia was using to pump unlimited ground water and is set to terminate three more in the coming year which seems like a win until you remember that American companies are doing the exact same thing I mean even Arizona's state pension fund has invested $175 million in a Wall Street company that's buying up land in Arizona for groundwater access and the pension fund only stopped when some people found out and push them to divest so yeah state governments need to rethink how they regulate groundwater and you can get involved by joining some of the local and state groups that are pushing for stronger or any legislation even pushing the government to measure not stop not cap measure how much groundwater is being removed would be a good start but a much more powerful fix would be to readdress the system of double Stampy no erases water rights that got us into this situation in the first place unfortunately this is not a simple thing to do because for the most part water rights holders are just Farmers trying to make a living sure there are a few Monster Mash sized Farms but there are thousands of struggling Farmers out there and if we charged them an extra million dollars for their water or just took it away that would be a real dick move it would also be an excellent way to starve America because that's where the food comes from and a lot of food is mostly water if you're tempted to think about this like a farmers versus City problem and that farmers are taking too much water just remember they're not using that water for slip and slides brother they're using it to grow crops and livestock that people in cities eat most Farmers aren't wasting their water they're deciding what to grow based on what they can make from the market and what the current water laws are but still water conservation's got to come from somewhere and if you're looking at the same charts that I am a pretty obvious place is cattle feed when it comes to the Colorado River if every single person and business in every major city shut off all their water valves you would only cut 177% of the water demand but again it's not that simple unwinding the law of the river would constitute a seismic shift in American Agriculture and honestly I have no idea how that would look but there are some actionable steps we can take to address water shortages most regulations require rights holders to allocate all the water or none of it and loosening some of these archaic policies could allow Farmers to conserve their water use through more efficient practices like like drip irrigation then sell their extra water the money from the extra water could even go to help fund some of those expensive drip irrigation installations so you know that's pretty nice the inflation reduction act has also earmarked a few billion dollars to help with the Western Water Crisis and it seems like about a billion of that might go to pay Farmers to follow their fields to save water is that the perfect solution I don't know but it is something and while cities and industries are just a small percentage of water use in the west we're still talking about trillions of gallons that means conservation efforts like not demanding every house in America comes standard with a Kentucky Bluegrass lawn AKA one of the largest irrigated crops in America now you may be saying well grass isn't a crop we don't eat it  exactly another way to conserve is to install lowf flow appliances and fixtures in buildings and houses as insane as it sounds the city of Las Vegas has actually been making a huge effort to conserve their water as are a lot of other cities in the west one study found that as population grew by 24% in the 28 urban areas they looked at overall water usage dropped by 18% which is pretty cool and if you're looking to get involved in an organization that works on these problems you are in luck my friend our buddies over at climate change makers have put together a Playbook that you can use to contact your local representatives to urge them to take action on water conservation through the upcoming farm bill so if you're looking for a policy solution solution to push forward check it out Link in the bio it's technically a description but I say bio so whenever I say either one just know that that's in the text below this video but the Big Mac father of all of them is probably to stop demanding and consuming so much meat and cheese and I know times are tough right now and those two items account for a lot of people's favorite food I'm not in charge of you you're the boss of your own body I will say that if the principles of supply and demand to be believed Farmers wouldn't use as much water to grow cattle feed if we didn't consume so much beef and dairy it takes literal hundreds of gallons of water to produce a single pound of either beef or cheese so a collective effort to reduce our consumption would actually have a big effect and I don't know what that means for you maybe it means going meat and dairy free for a few days a week or trying a plant-based meat alternative or any number of replacements for the current status quo of flooding a desert for cow food and in case you're thinking Americans are just hardwired to eat beef and there's simply no way to change that I guess I would point you to the fact that industry groups are constantly spending money trying to convince America's children to eat more meat and this should really be its own episode but if we all naturally eat beef then why are industry groups so hellbent on getting Pro meat propaganda into schools if everybody was just naturally drinking a bunch of milk all the time why would the dairy industry need to hire actual director Michael Bay to make this insanely highquality milk commercial and that was the Vienna wood dancing D and now let's make that random call with today's $110,000 question who shot Alexander Hamilton in that famous duel all right let's go to the phones and see who's out there hello hello for $10,000 who excuse me on let mil I'm sorry maybe next time got milk good Lord that is an awesome commercial imagine being so good at making commercials that they give you the Transformers franchise you get way more into the characters of the robots this time they're so good they're always doing the right thing they're always doing good and I think people like that and also for the kids out there there was a time when not everybody knew about the life of Alexander Hamilton before Linn Manuel Miranda nobody even knew that Alexander Hamilton was a rapper and this is just my personal opinion man but if everybody really liked milk you wouldn't have to make an ad about it milk is famous everybody knows what milk is just let the people decide if they want to drink milk leave me alone milk Kramer what am I drinking milk oh conclusion music we're home free baby okay if you take away just one thing from this episode it should be to think a little bit more about how the world uses its water now if you're concerned about your personal water usage it's a good idea to consider all the ways you use water and not just when you turn on the faucet or Blast Your Lawn water used on your behalf is also a big factor and that's influenced by a lot of things including what you eat and some archaic ass laws from the 1900s that you probably don't have a lot of control over okay that's the end of the episode I probably could have gone on for another hour about this but every episode has to end somewhere and I guess this is that somewhere there are a ton of other climate issues with animal Agriculture and I swear to Christ we're going to get to them we figured we'd start with water on account of how water is the thing that makes all life work and speaking of water big thanks to teato AKA Western water girl for all of her help with the research on this episode if you're looking to learn more about the Western us water shortage you simply must check out her videos seriously no notes 10 out of 10 go check them out also thanks so much to Young Farm on Long Island for letting us get a bunch of farmy looking shots they're doing great work out there we also bought some pies on our way out and let me tell you those Pi kicked ass ooh and all this pie talk has probably got you thinking do we still have a patreon page you better believe we do but something has changed something has shifted that's right we got an official climate Town phone line and now hot crackers if you're a patron you can call me not all the time not just any old time that would ruin my life okay there's going to be specific times you can call me and if you don't hit one of those times you can leave a message okay it's supposed to be for fun don't with me all right there's also a bunch of other fun perks on the patreon page we've also got a ton of fun perks on the patreon page like behind the scenes footage Town Halls a patreon only Discord Channel discount tickets to the live shows and a bunch of other stuff the patreon page is the backbone of climate town so if you like what we're doing and you want to support us patreon is a great place to do it we've also got t-shirts they're made by a company called TS designs in North Carolina and sent to you by the good Folks at ethics merch we made a whole episode about merch that you can check out but to summ it up these are nice shirts that are made entirely in the Carolinas with a fully transparent supply chain that actually pays workers a living wage if you want one of our very nice t-shirts you can buy one using the link down below we've also got a podcast called the climate denars Playbook hosted by me and my childhood friend and Daily Show writer Nicole conin and executive produced by Ben bolt and we have a newsletter that me and climate Town writer director Matt Nelson Wright there's links to all that in the description below that's the end of the video and I've been waiting quite a while to do this okay okay I have not tried marijuana uh I have never used it at any [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] time did you hear that pop goodbye"

      "transcript": "fashion is a powerful force in the modern world you think you're just throwing on your favorite band shirt but really you're now walking the streets in a magnet that attracts a few people you want to talk to and about a hundred absolute weirdos who haven't had a consensual conversation in over a decade seriously though buying and wearing merch can be a great way of supporting something you care about merchandizing and the t-shirt is everything I treasured that shirt I love that shirt but the problem with merch and the vast majority of modern clothing is that it's being made to be thrown away and that's not an exaggeration most of today's clothes are being manufactured for dirt cheap using terrible labor standards and lowquality materials and being shipped thousands of miles to stores around the world only to be worn an average of seven times before being discarded and ending up in a landfill and that's if they get worn at all because we are landfilling unused merchandise at a staggering rate and if you're wondering why all that unused merchandise doesn't just get donated to a thrift store a lot of it does but due to the sheer volume of clothing we produce up to 90% of donated clothes get rejected and chances are it'll end up right back at the dump with its friends it is now so cheap to make merch that companies will order thousands of shirts give away as many as they can for promotion and then trash whatever they've got left there's actually an industry term regarding branded merch they call it brandville which is exactly what it sounds like and I don't normally like puns but for some reason that one really pops but I don't want to sh on selling merch altogether it's one of the most consistent ways for bands and entertainers and content creators to make any money now that streaming services have absolutely destroyed album sales musicians are finding it a lot easier to make $15 selling one shirt than they are scraping together thousands of unique listens at less than half a penny per play now I may not be a singer songwriter fun guy to talk to at parties but since merch is a good way of getting the word out about your stuff we wanted to make some climate Town t-shirts when we found out about the mountains of disposable merch and the emissions and labor violations associated with it we decided we could feel okay about it by finding a supplier who sources their materials responsibly and pays their workers a living wage the thing is we simply could not find that person it was crazy we spent literal years looking around and not making merch but then we found a way to make shirts that we feel pretty good about we think could be a template for other people who want to make merch too are they perfect probably not but we figured we'd make an episode about the process and the overall problems with merch as we try to figure it out ourselves and maybe there's a way to make merch that doesn't feel terrible or maybe not you be the judge hi I'm Raley Williams the guy with the climate science and policy degree and the proud new owner of 846 climate Town t-shirts and this is a video about the heaping pile of garbage that is merch welcome to climate town [Music] now there was a time where if you heard a song you liked it probably sounded something like this then you just go home and have a nice long think about it that was being a music fan hey remember the time we heard that song that was pretty great but then they figured out a way to let you buy the record so you could hear the song at home what you're going to hear about today is nothing short of a miracle living stereo played on a record and that went well for a while but now everyone was so godamn addicted to music that they needed something more what' you do wrong this time pop they needed all their friends and family to know exactly what kind of music they liked they needed merch and back then it wasn't just t-shirts who heard you love Elvis friend how about some Elvis gum Elvis bracelets Elvis shoes maybe even some Elvis hound dog orange lipstick oh you hate Elvis fantastic here's a pin that says I hate Elvis or maybe you love The Beatles now beetles shirts are cool but you could also have a wig here's a lunch box how about some bobbleheads I'd like to get 1,500 I'd offer you like 200 bucks by the 1970s ACDC supposedly made more money selling merch than from selling tickets on their world tour and notorious face paint Enthusiast Jean Simmons is still talking about all the money he made from Kiss Merchant we outsell The Beatles and Elvis combined no other music Act of any kind has ever done as many chachkas as we have I'm hungry the idea of merch has expanded even further in the past few decades and has grown to include serial monstrosity coronation flakes in honor of the latest vampire who will get to be driven around the Streets of London but there is no more dominant item in the history of the multi-billion dollar merch industry than the T-shirt gas they are so popular that they become hilarious punchlines in famous comedy t-shirts I saw blank and all I got was this lousy t-shirt and of course been there done that got the T-shirt Bazinga they've even expanded Beyond bands to include TV shows movies government agencies pharmaceutical companies family 5Ks Bachelor parties and more an Alo Bloom of custom t-shirt companies exploded in the internet age and now there are thousands of companies is eager to take care of all your merch needs in minutes you can get multiple designs in a dozen colors and sizes all manufactured printed and shipped wherever you want want to sell them online no problem they'll even set up a website where anyone who wants your custom shirt can get it shipped straight to their house that's how easy it is and you can do it all for $5 a shirt [Â __Â ] wild and all of this might have been fine if it weren't for the hilariously devastating problems with how we manufacture modern clothing we actually did a whole video about fast fashion I recently rewatched it and honestly it holds up pretty good so give it a watch if you feel like it Link in the bio but there are a few important points to hit in order to make this video work and to make sure it's not boring let's deliver them in the style of a classic BuzzFeed list welcome You've Got Mail now this will come as a shock to exactly nobody but there are a [Â __Â ] ton of fully documented human rights abuses in the fashion industry the only thing more impressive than the sheer number of violations is the variety of abuses which include but are not limited to unsafe working conditions including over a thousand deaths in a single Factory collapse forced labor modern day slavery that's what rights groups say is going on brutally long hours sexual harassment child labor Jim how old are you and so much more to make a thousand custom shirts for 4.95 a shirt you're going to have to cut costs and that almost always means paying the people who make the shirts an absolutely unlivable wage just imagine paying someone to grow and harvest cotton paying someone else to process it and spin it into thread paying someone else to sew the shirt together paying another person to dye the shirts sew the tags on and a print killing it at a graphic from season 3 of The Walking Dead does that sound like the kind of thing you can pay someone a decent rate to make and still sell for [Music] [Applause] [Music] $749 the estimates are all over the map but no matter which study you pick the global greenhouse gas emissions produced by the apparel and Footwear industry are absolutely staggering the UN clocks it at about 8% of all the greenhouse gas emissions humans produce and these emissions come from multiple parts of the supply chain like burning fossil fuels for industrial equipment and electricity demand to Power Machinery but one of the big ones is transportation in 1965 the United States made about 95% of our clothing domestically by the '90s it was down to 50% and now we make 2% of our clothing here which means 98% of our clothes are made in other countries and that usually means multiple other countries because clothes are routinely sewn together in one country shipped to another country to be printed shipped to another country to be labeled and tagged shipped to another country to be packaged before being shipped to America and these trips are almost always being made using fossil fuel powered cargo ships trains or planes which and I hope you guessed it emit a whole lot of greenhouse gases and I truly cannot overstate the volume here we are drowning in products from places like shien and timu and whatever new Ultra fast fashion brands realize they can sell disposable clothes to Fashion crazed Americans and I kind of mean drowning literally here because there's an import loophole in the US called the DI Minimus exception that lets you ship a package to the US tarff free if it's less than $800 in value and in 2022 just xien and teu by themselves sent 210 million of these dominous packages which interestingly enough was the population of America when we used to make almost all of our clothes domestically really makes you think or maybe it doesn't we just kind of needed an ending to this section and that number kind of fit nicely so that's how the sausage is made [Music] baby before the year 2000 cotton was the number one ingredient in clothing and it's still a massive Global crop today that's frequently grown in dry areas requiring Farmers to use a huge amount of water for irrigation but don't worry because they're only growing about 70 billion pound of cotton every single year but since 2000 there's a new King in town I'm talking about polyester and it is [Â __Â ] everywhere including more than half of all the textiles we use today and here's the thing about polyester it's just plastic which means you right now are probably wearing plastic clothes and where does 99% of all plastic come from you guessed it oil and gas congratulations oil and gas you're not just producing CO2 to ship the clothes you are the clothes and I sure would love to talk about microplastics right now oh boy would I love to say something like between 200,000 and 500,000 tons of microplastics from textiles enter the global marine environment each year or even something like microplastics from your clothes can leech chemicals into your skin and we're basically doing a huge Global experiment to see how plastic tolerant the human body is but this is a buzzfeed list so I guess you want to see which greenhouse gas you are based on who your middle school Crush Was remember the first three bullet points overproduction makes all three of those a lot worse now the figures on how much we overproduce are actually really hard to nail down partially because we produce so many clothes all across the world and it's just really difficult to keep track of them each year we probably make somewhere between 80 and 150 billion articles of clothing and between 10 and 40% is just wasted never sold at all and even if you take the low side of both of those ranges without even considering the clothes people do buy that they probably don't really need you end up with billions of pieces of unnecessary brand new clothing heading right for the landfill or the incinerator or if they're really lucky they'll get to live out the rest of their days in the beautiful atakama desert in Chile in a massive dystopian heap of trash clothes that apparently sometimes Burns releasing all those synthetic fabrics and chemicals back into the sky as toxic smoke but I guess it's all worth it for an unlimited supply of shirts that say [Music] bazinga another one ooh baby we're back again because treating workers poorly and paying them as little as possible has become so normal and so expected that even the premium brands are doing the same [Â __Â ] in 2022 investigative journalism group follow the money published a report about sustainability Golden Child Patagonia and it turns out Patagonia manufactures clothes in some of the same factories as fast fashion companies the report claims that one day a factory might be manufacturing for Patagonia but the next day it might be Target or Amazon or Nike or Zara now in 2015 Patagonia made a pledge to pay all their apparel assembly workers a living wage within 10 years years that deadline is next year and what percent of factories that Patagonia uses pay a living wage oh no well okay well who's reporting that cuz there's a lot of fake news out there these days oh no it's their own website and this isn't to say Patagonia and Shen are both equally bad Patagonia is one of the most sustainable large scale apparel brands in the world they're donating money to a bunch of good causes they're facilitating the repurchase and reuse of their clothes through the warn Weare program and it was their own disclosure of their factories that led to the follow the money report they appear to be doing a lot of the right things that's how normalized this has become and if we're really going down this Rabbit Hole a lot of the clothing made in the US is from workers making less than minimum wage there are sweat shops in America the Department of Labor did a series of Sting operations in Los Angeles and found labor violations in 85% of factories including factories used by premium Brands like Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus so while you're almost guaranteed to be getting an environmentally damaging and or human rights abusing shirt if you pay $10 for it you can pay $100 for a shirt that's doing a lot of the same stuff it's enough to make you want to never put on a shirt again so what do you do sorry about that I uh I used to do that a lot that's kind of funny anyway so what do you do well we asked ourselves the same question our first thought was to not make anything new at all we ended up talking to a company that had 100 sun damage shirts to recycle we got them to send those shirts to us instead we printed climate town on them and sold them at live shows not too bad but while repurposing old shirts made sure we didn't add to the climate or labor problems getting a 100 sun damage shirts at random intervals isn't exactly a repeatable process for us or anyone else and it doesn't do a lot to make sure we're supporting the few people who were going out of their way to change the fashion industry so we didn't do [Â __Â ] for a few months but then one day we came across a company called ethics merch they run the merch program for the sunrise movement and third act and also a ton of unions across the country and when we asked them if they knew anybody who could make a t-shirt without you know underpaying their workers or beefing the planet too hard they pointed us to a company in North Carolina called TS designs founded by a man named Eric Henry his last name is a first name that's a good start see originally TS designs was a printer for a ton of Major Brands you know your Nikes your tomies your gaps that sort of thing they had a 100 employees who all had good jobs and health care and retirement plans but then after NAFTA and the globalization movement of the 1990s they went from 100 employees to 20 in 2 years and were on the brink of bankruptcy one of the true economic miracles in the whole history of civilization but then Eric decided to shift his company to making sustainable apparel right here in the US and about 15 years ago they started making their cotton of the Carolina's shirts instead of sending every shirt thousands of miles to be put together they use the radical breakthrough technology of getting cotton from a local farmer processing it locally and then making it into shirts and printing on it right there in the same part of the Carolinas it travels less than 800 mil to go from the farm to a full-on finished shirt and if you're having trouble visualizing this here's a nice map I made showing the cotton traveling around Indiana Jones style and this map is not a guess because every company that touches this shirt is trackable and verifiable there's even a QR code in the tag of the shirt that you can scan to see all the companies along the chain who by the way are paying their employees a living wage you want to call the cotton Jenner okay they might not pay up they might be busy but that's their number and also cotton of the Carolina shirts are truly 100% cotton which means they're not messing around with plastic at all not even in the thread also they dry Farm their cotton which means it doesn't require extra irrigation the way we determine if Cotton's ready to pick is if that seed will pop did you hear that pop TS designs has even developed their own printing process which doesn't leave ink on top of the shirts which makes them easier to recycle or if they're in a landfill decompose finally scraps from production go to a company called material return which is a worker-owned Cooperative by the way pretty cool who recycle them into recycled cotton thread what I'm trying to say is that we just really like what companies like TS designs are up to and for the record they did not pay us to say this quite the opposite we paid them thousands of dollars to do a run of climate Town shirts but we also think it's important to shout them out as much as possible cuz it's good to promote things you want to see more of in the world TS designs cotton of the Carolinas QR codes and of course any and of course any good band shirt needs art luckily AI can do that for free and it's actually getting pretty good at remembering that hands usually have five fingers so [Â __Â ] you illustrators out that no I'm just kidding we hired a fantastic artist named Margalit Cutler whose work has been in the New Yorker New York Magazine and a bunch of other places not from New York she made us a couple of slick designs and here they are pretty cool huh HH huh okay this that's too many faces and just in case you forgot who made the art there's her signature right there pretty sneaky huh anyway margalit's art gets printed on those cotton of the Carolina shirts which then go to the good Folks at ethics where they drop them in a recycled cardboard shipper from a company called Eco and close and send them right off to you finally completing the Indiana Jones map I hate these guys wow you couldn't make a movie like Indiana Jones anymore what with cancel culture anyway that's the story of how we made climate Town shirts we printed up 423 of each design and we're going to see how it goes proceeds go directly back to making videos like this and also podcasts and newsletters and whatever the hell this is is anyone here a doctor we don't need for real anybody got a master's degree need a little bit of water just a little bit of water a master's degree in a hard in a hard science just a little bit of water a hard science right there get up here is this the perfect process again probably not but I think it's a good way to get the ball rolling in the other direction and if you yourself are thinking about having some custom t-shirts made for your band or your bachelorette party or your pharmaceutical convention I think these are some good things for you to keep in mind on your T-shirt Journey and they may cost a little bit more but that's closer to what a t-shirt should actually cost anyway here's the shirts that we made pretty cool huh back to you Raleigh thanks Raleigh okay let's wrap this thing up there are a lot of climate problems that are so far outside of the hands of individuals that the only thing that can really help is Big policy induced systemic change and while there are a lot of parts of fast fashion that could benefit from policy change in this case consumer demand AKA us buying stuff is also a major factor but bonus it's a factor that you yes you yes you not you too tall but yes you and even you can have some control over you can start by wearing the clothes you already have and if your wardrobe is totally busted like mine is and you want to switch it up a little bit you can do a clothing swap with your friends or Community or buy used clothes secondhand remember a lot of these secondhand clothes have have probably never even been worn I mean it's a pretty thin upside to our over production problem but it's there you can also be more Discerning with your buying Habits by trying to send a clear Market signal by buying from companies that you feel are doing a good job it is super hard to shop with any kind of certainty nowadays because companies know what they're doing as a problem and will often fill their websites with empty promises rather than actual change but there are some links in the description to help you find some responsible manufacturers and also a few minutes on popular search engine google.com can give you a better sense of who you're thinking of buying from it ain't easy okay if it was easy it wouldn't be a huge problem and I wish it was as simple as never buy any clothes ever again but even that falls victim to the divest versus invest problem there's a big push to divest from things like fossil fuels corporate farming and fast fashion and that is a really great push like keep doing that for sure but going the extra mile means reinvesting on the solution side of the problem like investing in renewable energy regenerative agriculture or slow fashion so by all means adjust your personal buying habits but just remember nothing hits quite like policy and lucky for us there's a hot Little Bill coming through the New York state legislature called the fashion act and if it gets passed as is any fashion brand clearing over 100 million in annual revenue would be subject to a Litany of environmental and human rights standards it's honestly a little that the only way to get companies to care about the environment or human rights is to force them to but them's the breaks our friends over at climate change makers have put together a whole Playbook on ways you can get involved with your state legislature and you can check it out Link in the description and once more with feeling this time we made climate Town shirts I'm so happy about them they came out really great buying them will not save the planet but it was an incredibly eye-opening experience trying to go through the process of making shirts with any amount of sustainability in mind and if you'd like to commemorate that process by buying yourself a t-shirt I think that would be a very cool idea you just had there's a link right below the YouTube video should be right below the YouTube video I'm not a 100% sure that we will have figured that out by the time you're watching this so if it's not there check in the description if it is there you can use that link if you feel like it okay big thanks to Eric Henry and TS designs for making shirts that we actually feel good about bringing into this world and also thanks again to ethics merch and folks like Daniel and Ruth who guided us through this process and are running the store for us they're working on connecting ethical and sustainable apparel companies with people who want to buy ethical and sustainable [Â __Â ] and they've done exactly that thing for us and also huge thank you to margarite Cutler for doing the art and forever immortalizing this mustache on a t-shirt if I'm being completely honest it kind of freaks me out but the real question is do we still have a patreon page hell yes we do and we actually added a whole bunch of new tiar and perks and cut footage and town halls and all kinds of [Â __Â ] that makes it actually kind of good so check it out Link in the bio also if we get to 5,000 paid patrons by June 1st I will install a telephone right here on my desk that you can call if you're a patron wow doesn't that sound like an incredible waste of time for both both of us probably you'll have to find out also also we have a podcast called the climate deniers Playbook that features me and Daily Show writer slm my childhood friend Nicole Conlin also also also we have a newsletter written by me and climate Town writer director Matt Nelson links to all that in the description and that's it thanks so much for watching really appreciate you see you next time okay I'm hungry I have not not tried marijuana uh I have never used it at any [Music] [Applause] time did you hear that goodbye"

      "transcript": "ah electricity lightning in a bottle the devil's juice Thor piss now I had it with the de the devil's juice I almost never think about it when it's working but when my electricity goes out for even a minute it is a Hindenburg level tragedy now 15 years ago a lot of the power to make this electricity would have come from coal dirty polluting frankly rude coal and that would have made me sick but nowadays I don't have to be sick or even feel bad about it at all because there's a new number one electricity producer in America I'm talking about natural gas and even better everybody loves it not just those Brave Patriots who refuse to cook on anything else they decided gas powered stoves racist and have to go I have actually taped myself to my stove I've been here for 24 hours now GOP thrusts Gast stoves Biden's green agenda into the culture wars oh not the culture wars probably true see conservatives love how natural gas comes from our own domestic sources and hello bipartisanship all those Godless Kami Liberals are also on team natural gas because it led to this incredible decrease in our carbon dioxide emissions and if you're just looking at this graph you might be tempted to think switching from coal to natural gas was great for the climate but unfortunately the house of natural gas was built on the found Foundation of ignoring one critical aspect gas has a tendency to leak and you might find yourself asking so what you know so some of the gas doesn't make it to the power plant who cares but the thing about natural gas is that it's mostly made up of methane that's the part that explodes so nice oh yeah and we probably shouldn't even call it Natural Gas G because the word natural implies that it's maybe good or clean burning or something when really it's almost entirely methane which is a greenhouse gas meaning when it gets in the atmosphere it absorbs the heat that was escaping into space and sends it right back down to warm up the planet just like CO2 except it's actually not just like CO2 because methane can trap 80 times more heat than carbon dioxide in a 20-year period it's like when LeBron James is playing high school basketball he's 6'8 and they are 95 lb soaking wet uh-oh is it true so yeah when you're just comparing coal and natural gas AKA methane at the power plant gas generates a little less than half the CO2 that coal does but when you take into account the many many methane leaks at the well heads in the processing plants and the compressor stations and the 3 million miles of pipelines natural gas's climate imp impacts in the US are right back in Coal territory baby and we don't even know the full extent of the damage gas has caused because leaks are really hard to detect and the primary method the US government used to account for leaks was to ask the oil and gas companies how much methane they were leaking and then take their word for it awesome and every year we're getting more invested in natural gas it's now 40% of our power generation in the US making it the number one source of our electricity and we also pipe gas to factories and houses and Office Buildings and a ton of other places for them to burn themselves and despite burning about 88 billion cubic feet of natural gas every single day we are producing so much of it that we're also super cooling it down into liquefied natural gas loading it up on ships and then sending it away to other countries all across the world a process I will note that requires a ton of extra energy and emits even more methane making it worse for the climate than coal in a lot of scenarios and it's not just like a little bit of LNG in 8 years we went from basically not exporting it at all to being the world's number one LNG exporter and I know America loves exporting our culture but normally it's pretty innocuous like trying to get French people to try our blonde guys nachos but in this case exporting our obsession with natural gas has the potential to lock the entire Globe into using yet another dangerous polluting fossil fuel for decades to come but maybe there's something we can do about it maybe and for once there's actually some good news about natural gas at the end of this video so you'll just have to wait 40 minutes how is this video 40 minutes I have to edit the what am I doing well let's get to it hi I'm Raley William a guy with a climate science and policy degree and about two more good years left in me and this is a video about the natural gas industry scamming America welcome to climate [Music] town the year was 2009 and a fresh-faced Barack Hussein Obama had just won the presidential election by refusing to show the future president his birth certificate Bazinga but as soon as Obama got the keys to the White House car he found himself driving directly into the oncoming traffic of a recession a ton of unemployment and a climate change inducing amount of coal power now Obama didn't love Coal Power but American presidents have typically had one priority that's over everything else energy security we're here to talk about America's energy security an issue that's been a priority for my Administration since the day I took office energy security energy security security of our energy in 2009 Cole was King and everyone from the coal companies themselves to the Energy Information Administration were going long on that Kentucky Rock STI environmentalists climate Advocates and a whole bunch of other people hated it but coal was cheap plentiful and it ran the [Â __Â ] country for the past Century don't you go near my coal but then Cole had one of those moments where it coughed and its friends were like Cole are you okay and there were minor chords playing and it said yeah I'm good but Cole was not good because the new technology had loaded up its sleigh with jobs and energy security and climate action for all the boys and girls that's right I'm talking about fracking [Music] and also directional drilling now come on you've heard of fracking it sounds like the kind of thing a Sci-Fi character would say as a swear word but it was actually one of the most important developments in all of American History seriously right up there with the moon landing or the invention of the high five now historically American oil and gas production has been a real roller coaster there was a time when you could be out burying your dog and enough oil and gas would pop out of the ground for you to buy a th000 dogs but by the early 2000s conventional oil production in the US was way down and natural gas was hanging on by a threat and since America still loved fossil fuels that meant we were going to have to get them from foreign governments in Geneva yesterday OPEC slapped another large increase on crude oil prices gasoline shortages are spreading across the country say all out of gas no man you supposed to to at 8:00 it's A4 to 9: what are you doing in line and we draw the line at other countes trying to push us around pushing other countries around is our thing we own it we invented it you can't have it you know what you can't have blam one of those how about a second one and I bet you never seen one of these before okay uh fracking is short for hydraulic fracturing which means using water and other fluids to literally fract the [Â __Â ] out of that rock freeing the trapped hydrocarbons and sucking them into the fluid now fracking itself was not a new technology but because they could only drill in Fairly straight lines you can only SEAL Team Six smaller sections of the rock before you got through the Shale layer that held most of the oil and gas fracking and horizontal drilling came together in the 2000s to unlock a ton of oil and gas that was previously thought to be too expensive to extract and while fracking doesn't sound like the kind of thing environmentalists would think is very cool and it would almost certainly make enemies out of a bunch of people who could suddenly light their drinking water on fire fra natural gas had a climate angle that gas companies were very good at using it would be a bridge fuel Bridge fuel Bridge fuel Bridge fuel is nothing more than a bridge guys we know natural gas is a fossil fuel and it's extractive and it's not great for the environment and we hate that about it we really do we hate that but all that fracked gas could replace that stinky old coal while you guys are getting Renewables to work or whatever we love solar we love all that renewable crap let's go windmills am I right so how about partnering with big daddy natural gas and then when you guys get your little windmills to work we'll totally leave we promise I must have missed 60 Minutes what are you saying so natural gas fever blew through American politicians like a tornado in an Ikea environmental groups aren't so easily fooled but since America's coal addiction seemed like our biggest problem progressives were willing to temporarily Embrace natural gas as a bridge fuel to replace coal and an Unholy Alliance was formed between natural gas and environmental Advocates like the water keeper Alliance the American Lung Association and the Sierra Club the concept that we were trying to convey was to say eventually we have to be off all fossil fuel fuels but we have to get off coal first oil second and gas third and Obama is making speeches like this it's the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change we it turns out are the Saudi Arabia of natural gas it could support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade in a cleaner and cheaper way and having a nearly Limitless supply of fracked natural gas right beneath our feet it seemed too good to be true it was too good to be true obviously it was you're very perceptive I watch 60 minutes so if you remember the intro yes methane gas really does emit less CO2 than coal for electricity generation but that doesn't take into account a fun little thing called fugitive emissions see when coal falls out of a coal car it just becomes an adorable little rock but when methane leaks out of a pipe it becomes an invisible gas with a seemingly insatiable desire to grab on to heat and return it to the planet and that wouldn't really be a problem if methane didn't leak every godamn all the time here's a former Exxon engineer from a truly wonderful Frontline doc series about oil and gas when they were marketing natural gas as clean energy they didn't really know what they were talking about because they were fixated on the idea that natural gas when burned produces half the carbon dioxide emissions of coal the industry was not monitoring methane leakage so they did not have data about how much was leaking and there wasn't much appetite for management to measure methane leakage because if they found out there was a problem they would have to do something about it the increase in global temperature for methane is staggering scientists estimate that methane is responsible for 20 to 30% of the modern climate warming despite there being 200 times less methane than C2 in the atmosphere terrifying and more on that feeling after this who what is this a ad no not a ad well yes a ad but not a ad for like Patriot powder for your underground bunker this is unad for the climate Town patreon page yes here at climate town we spend weeks researching topics calling experts and watching hours of footage from the 1980s before we even write a single word of a script cing with gasing with gas and the only reason we can take that kind a time is because of our supporters on patreon and starting right now I'm sweetening the deal with a whole bunch of extra patreon perks that are actually a little bit good yeah I'm talking a patreon only Discord Channel even more behind the scenes exclusives bloopers live Q&A sessions with the climate town team after episode releases and more maybe you're thinking I like the videos but how do I know they use my money responsibly let me tell you here at clim Town we're frugal see these whiteboards free on Craigslist just cuz the edges were a little [Â __Â ] up see this couch it's uncomfortable and I hate the way it looks but I love the way my sister's co-worker sold it to me for $40 see all these bags of coffee they were expired so we got them for free this is hundreds of dollars worth of coffee this is a drug bust worth of coffee what I'm trying to say is that here at climate town we use money responsibly and that is an official climate Town promise okay well I can explain that obviously we got it for free on credit card points on account of howed up my face looks so if you like what we're doing and you want to support us you might want to check out our patreon page and if you're already on there you don't have to do anything extra but I encourage you to check out the new tiers and offerings and just to wet your Collective whistles you dry little whistlers we're doing an incentive thing here if we get to 5,000 patrons we're currently at like 3700 we get to 5,000 by June 1st I will install a telephone right here and I'll answer that phone I will answer anyone who calls it and it's going to be like an old school phone like the kind Al paccino has in the movie Heat okay we'll give you the number you call it and then it rings the phone which I will then diligently answer at the very least for the full first day if it starts to affect my ability to edit and get these videos done maybe we'll move to like a monthly call-in thing I'm not sure the climate Town patreon will'll use that money real good wow what a ad anyway methane can get into the atmosphere from a bunch of different sources landfills animal agriculture even wildfires release methane but the oil and gas industry is responsible for more than a quarter of all the methane that Americans put into the atmosphere and that's just wasted methane it's not heating any houses is not making any electricity it's just needlessly escaping the oil and gas system where it will do nothing but contribute to global warming for years to come and remember that's just the methane the oil and gas industry has reported missing there's a whole bunch more leaked methane that goes unreported and we have no idea how much it is because it's really hard to track first of all natural gas is odorless and colorless which means if it's leaking but you're not looking at it you're probably not going to notice anything that special stink smell is added before they sell gas to Consumers so you can tell when your gas is leaking because one time in the 1930s an entire School exploded and they figured stinking it up a bit might help keep casualties down when it's leaking out of a well head or a processing plant and you're not actively looking at it through an $80,000 methane vision camera you're probably not going to see or smell anything and speaking of not actively looking for it the epa's traditional method of monitoring for gas Leakes really was to ask the oil and gas companies that's it the millions of miles of gas pipelines and infrastructure were to be self-monitored and self-reported and since there are fines for releasing methane they could either tell on themselves and pay the fine or let the invisible plume of gas that no one knows about just blow away and keep their money and God damn I have heard of some huge conflicts of interest but this one has got to be top 10 [Music] it's now you might be thinking this sounds a lot like conjecture do you have some kind of specific example you can use right here to stick the landing on this bit yes in August of 2023 a valve at a Philips 66 facility in Texas failed and leaked 9.5 million cubic feet of natural gas directly into the atmosphere and since I had no fing clue how much 9.5 million cubic feet meant that's 300,000 lb of a gas poured directly into the sky and no one reported it but then several months later a nonprofit called carbon mapper was looking at some satellite data that just happened to be recording Over Texas at that time and discovered the enormous unreported methane leak over the Philips 66 facility Bloomberg green asked Philip 66 for comment in November and wouldn't you know it but 6 days later Philip 66 reported the methane leak to Texas State regulators and this is just my own personal speculation but it really seems like if that satellite hadn't been watching that exact area and carbon mapper hadn't been crunching the numbers that methane leak would have gone unreported and I will go on to speculate that this is not the first time fossil fuel companies have covered up their methane leaks I guess what I'm trying to say is that there is a [Â __Â ] ton of methane leaking out of the oil and gas industry one study estimates that just us natural gas pipelines buy themselves leak between 1.2 and 2.6 million tons of methane every year this has the climate impact of adding between 25 million and 50 million additional cars to the roads in just wasted fugitive emissions so if you're the kind of person who wants to do a cost benefit analysis here you'll find you can afford to lose about 3 to 5% of the methane through leaking before natural gas is worse for the climate than the coal it was supposed to be replacing the US government used to think we were leaking about 1.4% which is already not great but after some more in-depth studies the White House acknowledges it's more like 2.3% or higher and it seems like the more we look at fugitive methane emissions the more we realize we've been underestimating them for decades by a lot and that's not to say that coal is secretly good it's not it's bad they're both bad options it's like we spent billions of dollars to replace a heroin addiction with an opioid epidemic which to America's Credit is extremely on brand and I know I've been talking about gas leaks and methane emissions for a while and this is all stuff that's apparent to us now but it's important to look at this in context back in the 2010s when we were going Hog Wild on natural gas it was much less obvious how the next 10 to 20 years might go they were scared shitless that coal use would continue to pump CO2 into the atmosphere and they were just so Ding Dang excited that this new American Natural Gas could burn cleaner and it wasn't just The Vibes natural gas had those three letters that you always want on your side I'm talking of course about MIT that's right in 2011 the massive Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy initiative released a massive study called the future of natural gas it was written by about 20 MIT dorks with the support of a stacked advisory committee and you don't have to read all 308 pages to get to their very official take it's right there in the forward and acknowledgements the US has a ton of gas and it could be a bridge fuel to a lowc carbon future in short let's [Music] Frack well I guess that's that case closed I mean it's MIT after all yeah you know what let's just take a quick look at the sponsors just in case something comes up first and foremost we thank the American clean Skies Foundation discussions with the foundation led to the conclusion that an integrative study on the future of natural gas in a carbon constrained world could contribute to the energy debate in an important way and the foundation stepped forward as the major sponsor uh awesome the American clean Skies Foundation yes guys damn when I wake up in the morning and I look out the window and the sky is clean I am sure there's nothing to look into here but see as I'm already [Music] here thank you Mr chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to discuss the great promise of natural gas in the United States Aubrey mcclinon CEO of chese energy and and also chairman of the American clean Skies foundation and also chairman of the American clean Skies Foundation curious a fracking company a big fracking guy it's fracking money huh yeah that's right the American clean Skies Foundation was formed and funded by the CEO of Chesapeake Energy one of the Premier fracking companies in America so it might not come as a huge shock that the abstract of the paper praises the abundance lowcost and CO2 emission reduction capabilities of natural gas while noting that the Environmental fin impacts are challenging but manageable we have to roll all the way down to page 171 after the end of the main report to appendix 1A to find a more in-depth discussion of fugitive emissions and even in that appendix it mostly adds up to we don't know enough to talk about it and if the leaks are bad I'm sure they'll get better in the future but maybe one of the authors of the paper Ernest mon would care to comment roll it front line monise would not talk about it in our interview other than to say it was transparent it the point is we always believe in transparency and and so that's yeah so yeah the 2010s turned out to be a sort of jumbalaya of people willing to downplay the problems with natural gas for various reasons and by 2012 natural gas had the full support of the tosos presents the president of the United States the development of natural gas we'll create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy and by the way it was public research dollars over the course of 30 years that helped develop the Technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale R reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground and after thato it was on hot diggity dog America there's a new kid in town and his name is Johnny natural gas that's right gas production is booming like a flamethrower at a popcorn convention Obama says jump natural gas says you got it Daddy O and who's that at the door why it's the new Secretary of Energy Ernest monise and no not a different Ernest monise the same Ernest mon as before the guy who wrote the Mit paper about the glories of natural gas Blast Off more natural gas and while we're at it have a cigarette and relax about all those gas leaks because in 2013 the EPA lowered their estimates for how much methan in the oil and gas industry was leaking by 20% why did the EPA do that because the oil and gas industry pinky swore it was true did the EPA do their own testing to verify no they did not and ring a dingding what's this for the first time in American history natural gas beats out coal is the number one power source in the USFA what an upset seriously and not to blabber this point but in 2009 America's most informed energy agency the EI predicted coal would be our number one power source for decades to come the foreseeable future and then 6 years later natural gas came through and made him look like a bunch of Charlie Horses so it's kind of an important point to remember then it seemed like Obama was starting to take methane a little more seriously with a clean power plan and some methane leak restrictions but oh no here comes Trump and boom there go the clean power plan boom there go those methane leak restrictions boom Trump tries to bring back coal but bang natural gas Cuts him off with the the past my God gas is King now can anybody beat natural gas nope he couldn't do it natural gas continues to dominate modern American electricity generation we're fracking a record high amount of gas new pipelines were approved despite environmental opposition but not so fast Jackson the Biden Administration is making some major climate moves including the biggest piece of climate legislation in US history lower energy cost for millions of families I'm going to take the most aggressive action ever ever ever to confront the climate crisis but natural gas is still not going down that's enough of that I don't know what year it is for you but for me it's 2024 and the natural gas industry is only expanding every calendar year they're spending billions on new gas infrastructure to accommodate the ever increasing amount of fracked gas unfortunately all that Supply means American Gas producers have to slow down their fracking operation come on I'm just kidding they're going to get our friends addicted to natural gas too that's right I'm talking about the black tar heroin of methane liquefied natural [Music] gas basically fossil fuel companies are fracking and extracting natural gas here in America loading it onto big special boats and sending it to places like the EU the UK Japan South Korea and India and if you're picking up on the pattern of this episode yes lngg is significantly more damaging to the climate than regular natural gas for a couple of obvious reasons for one the only way to make any money shipping natural gas around the world in a big big boat is to cram it in there real tight and that means turning that gas into a liquid but the only way to do that is to Mr Freeze it down until it gets so cold it doesn't want to be a gas anymore which doesn't happen until you get to - 260Â° F which means right off the bat you have to waste about 8% of all the natural gas just to power the liquefaction process and that's not even considering the export terminals tendency to get a little leaky and then there are the LNG tankers which burn a ton of fuel to move that LNG all over the world that fuel is either one of the most polluting fuel sources we have known as heavy fuel oil or bunker fuel or just the natural gas itself now the trips are thousands of miles long which allow leak prone LNG ships plenty of opportunity to seep methane out into the atmosphere as they're tra tring to their destination woo all that's left now is to turn that liquid gas back into a gas gas which requires even more gas for power oh and these are specialized single-purpose funky ass gas tankers which means they have to make the thousands of miles long return Journey empty well not quite empty they have to keep some of that LNG on board so the tanker doesn't break down on the way back and all of these LG related emissions happen before the gas gets used for its intended purpose where it will release more emissions a recent paper from 2023 found that the greenhouse gas emissions associated with LNG can be quite a bit higher than coal depending on the type of fuel the ship uses and the length of the trip and remember the United States is not a side character in The LNG world before 2016 we exported exactly zero LNG from the lower 48 states but in the 8 years since we became the number one exporter on the planet the absolute Bonanza of LNG began with a tiny little press release from the eia about Louisiana shipping its first cargo of domestically sourced natural gas out of the Sabine Pass export terminal they had gotten all their permits they had built their facility and on February 24th 2016 they wave goodbye to their little boat full of hopes and dreams and LNG Bound for Brazil oh and also there were four other massive LNG export terminals being bolted together at warp speed at the exact same time soon all five were online and another three have come online since for a total of eight operational export terminals each one costing billions to tens of billions of dollars to construct and capable of exporting between 200 million and 4.55 billion cubic feet of gas per day that's about 10% of the natural gas we produce in America going overseas every single day and of course on a local level all that new LNG infrastructure produces some nasty air pollution and a ton of other issues for the people who happen to be living in the places that private companies wanted to set up their export Terminals and they're being built in high income areas with predominantly white residents sorry wait a minute [Â __Â ] and being the world's number one exporter of L G might be enough for lesser countries but here in the United States it's not even close here's the LNG capacity we currently have and here's the LNG capacity that's currently under construction that's right we are set to more than double the amount of LNG we can export to other countries and remember this is permanent infrastructure being built by companies who expect to get Decades of use out of it and if you think we're stopping here you must be out of your godam mind because here's the LG capacity the United States government has already issued permits for we are world champions right now but just you wa till we're at triple capacity and since these projects regularly lock in long-term contracts for their natural gas it's going to be pretty tough to decrease Global gas demand 20% by 2030 and 75% by 20150 you know the numbers the International Energy agency has made it very clear we need to to hit to get to Net Zero by 2050 in order to avoid catastrophic climate change catastrophic what a word great word a lot of good C's and T's in there catastrophic good A's too good a sound and it is at this time that I ask you in what way is a constant and massive expansion of entrenched natural gas infrastructure planned over decades treating it like a bridge fuel a bridge fuel Bridge fuel we need an energy source that will serve as a bridge like first gen's natural gas natural gas when I think of a bridge I think of a path between point a and point B what I'm seeing here is an amazing effort to turn point a into an unsalable Fortress of natural gas that has no intention of winding itself down in favor of renewable energy increasing exports kind of seems like a way of further entrenching natural gas demand across the globe and of course it does in what world is the natural gas industry going to willingly put itself out of business it's crazy it's like making a deal with the devil and then being shocked to find yourself getting absolutely by the devil it's the devil that's his whole thing it's the devil Kramer the devil now you remember that hole here's our LM capacity now but here's the capacity we have under construction and here's the capacity that's been permitted and ready to break ground well there's a fourth one it's the LG capacity we'll have if all the proposed projects get permitted and built and my friend it is a real bear this would represent an LNG capacity that is almost five times greater than our current world number one capacity but I'm using the subjunctive tense here because the the Biden Administration recently paused permitting for new LNG infrastructure to look at drum roll please the climate implications of LNG infrastructure that's right if you remember hearing a lot about LNG in the news recently it might have been something like this it's the administration trying to say that storms are bad so we're going to ban these exports freezing the export of liquefied natural gas or maybe it was more like this this is all designed in the end the whole climate Hysteria to to enable China to become the global dominant now these are fun but not uh what's that thing accurate see basically there's an LNG export terminal in Louisiana called kushu pass it currently exists and It produced its first LNG in January of 2022 now they really wanted to expand with a second kushu pass terminal or cp2 but a whole bunch of climate activists made a big old racket about it within 10 years American exported LNG will be producing more greenhouse gases than everything that happens on the continent of Europe and it actually worked not only did the Biden Administration pause the permitting for cp2 but they stopped issuing any new LNG permits so they could assess things like the perilous impacts of methane on our planet and this is not a minor change in the way we permit LNG before this the department of energy had never denied an NG permit for a project that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had already signed off on it's not every day that a presidential Administration takes a meaningful swing at the oil and gas industry in fact it happens on almost no days ever it's like the Cubs win the World Series kind of rare natural gas has gotten an incredible amount of special treatment since it exploded onto the scene and this decision could be signaling a change in the way we view methane now I don't want to get out over my skis here this decision only affects this portion of LNG in America and there's still a [Â __Â ] ton of climate work to be done but this my friends is an official win in my book and oh my God we finally made it to the what we're going to do about it phase of the video congratulations people out there first absolutely foremost we got to avoid the coal versus natural gas trap we can't compare the two worst options and then pick between those two options we don't want want to do either of them it's like asking if you want to drink diet piss or piss zero the answer is water please and in this case that means uh Renewables like solar wind Hydro probably some nuclear and energy storage to balance the grid second and this is a quick one remember that natural gas is basically just methane there's a ton of studies that show that when people hear natural gas they think it's good but when people hear methane they think it's bad despite the fact that it's basically the same thing so remember that third judging by all the natural gas infrastructure we keep on building methane gas is going to be around for a while and that means it's going to keep leaking so we need to continue to fight for tighter methane leak standards how do we do that great question our friends over at climate change makers have put together a Playbook on ways you can get involved in methane leak advocacy check it out right now leak in the bio and double bonus it's about to get a lot easier to track leaks thanks to the incredible work of two climate groups who are sending fullon satellites up into the night sky to detect methane leaks from space big shout out to carbon mapper and the environmental defense fund with their new satellite data and all the other Leak Detection improvements we might finally get a more complete picture of just how much methane is leaking into the atmosphere and I just got to imagine that real leak monitoring is going to be a better system than calling up fossil fuel companies and asking them what up what up what up what up that was comedy 20 years ago all right if you take away anything from this episode just remember to get more educated about the climate crisis we got a bunch of resources in the description we got some videos we got articles and books even books they're still there remember books books computers for going to [Music] sleep wow we did it all of us did it you and me equal effort on all sides we made it thank you so much for watching and thank you to climate power and Canary media for partnering with us on this episode the world of methane gas is a dark and scary one but their support research and Reporting were incredibly helpful on making this video and don't forget to check out our new and improved patreon page God damn you really got to check out all the new perks we're offering and there are even more just go check it out you curious little fox and I'm not kidding about that phone thing I'll install that son of a b right here if we get to 5,000 patrons by June 1st that's a Scout's Honor promise the biggest promise a scout can make and yes I Was A Boy Scout and guess what else we got we got a newsletter baby that's right me and writer director Matt Nelson write about all the stuff we couldn't cram into the less than 10 videos we make every year it's a lot of fun it's good climate info it's the same writing team as the climate Town episodes and if you sign up it'll show up right in your inbox that's a guarantee we've also also got a podcast called the climate deniers Playbook and I host it with my childhood friend and Daily Show writer Nicole conin basically we sit at a big table with our producer Ben bolt and we break down climate disinformation campaigns and honestly it's a lot of fun we just started releasing episodes of our new season so if you haven't listened before you picked a great time to start friend and that's it we did it and just remember there is a secret Easter egg hunt embedded throughout all these videos and literally no one has found it yet am I joking who knows I'm not okay okay I have not tried marijuana uh I have never used it at any [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] time sh"
