      "transcript": "climate change's Devastation is hitting us today from extreme weather to Rising seas and if we want to stop this Devastation we have to stop the world from heating which means we have to stop burning fossil fuels so how do we stop burning fossil fuels well now new research is revealing what we're doing that's already working and what we could do to build Unstoppable momentum towards our carbon free future I'm Adam a climate scientist with a PhD from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change and today I want to talk about how we stop climate change in this video I don't want to discuss the end goal stopping emitting or the technical steps getting rid of fossil fuels and building up clean energy because honestly I've spoken about both these topics loads already I want to focus on how we can actually get ourselves get our societies to take these steps now I hate to be the bearer of bad news but we are not on track the world is emitting billions of tons more greenhouse gases than it should be and we're heading for an overwhelming 3° Celsius by the end of this Century that would smash through our heating limits keeping warming to under two or ideally just 1.5° C and the more we heat the planet the more homes are in inundated by Rising Seas the more lives are lost to devastating disasters and the more people struggling to get enough water or enough food so back to that question how do we stop climate change and two Studies have just come out to help us answered one looks at what's actually worked in the past and another has reflected on what could build Unstoppable momentum in the future so let's look back to the past first now this paper looked at over 1,5 500 policy measures across the past 20 years covering countries in six continents so they couldn't be bothered to analyze anarctica this seems unusually late to introduce the quizzical character well better late than never which is kind of the climate action catchphrase let's get back to the study let's the researchers wanted to know which of the 1,500 policies actually lowered emissions but surely analyzing 1,500 individual policies would take forever isn't there a way they could get a machine to learn to do it instead so the researchers used machine learning to do it okay that figures using this artificial intelligence technique they could look for cases where emissions actually dipped then the researchers could work back from these dips and find the policies that caused them and the first result is that there were actually cases when emissions dipped really because it feels like we're making zero progress towards net zero yeah well I definitely get this feeling because we for sure are not making enough progress but we are for sure making progress in fact another study recently showed that high CO2 emission scenarios are thankfully now impossible because of progress in climate Tech and economics okay so great some climate policies have actually worked to cut emissions but which well out of the 1,500 policy adoptions the study found large emissions reductions in 6 9 cases don't say it seriously don't say it because there's nothing nice about the fact that there were just 69 cases leading to large emissions reductions okay yeah that isn't great but why did these policies succeed where hundreds of others fail well the study found that combinations of policies are much more effective than Standalone policies which makes sense right we humans often need multiple motivators when we want to change our Habits Like quitting smoking by reminding yourself how much cigarettes suck but also by giving yourself little treats to congratulate yourself on kicking the habit and that's what we see in a lot of these climate policy combinations so Norway managed to lower transport emissions by Banning combustion engines and actively making electric cars cheaper so reminding drivers that fossil fuels suck and giving a little treat for clean Alternatives but wait Norway is Banning combustion engine cars that would never work in my country funny you should say that because the study also found that what works in one country might not work in another take the power sector in richer countries policies that make dirty energy harder to make and sell are best at lowering emissions but in poorer countries making clean energy cheaper with subsidies was most successful okay so this study showed that some policies worked and others didn't but how is that helpful it's helpful because now countries can make sure they Implement policies that will actually work and that could help us get emissions cuts on track but there's another crucial part of the equation for getting us on the right Future Path Society you mean like us right and the other study is all about us and the Tipping elements that could help save the day oh I've heard of tipping elements oh wait aren't they really bad well yeah in climate science we often talk about tipping elements or tipping points these are points of no return where we push the climate so far that it suddenly tips into a different state and can't be brought back at least not easily for example the vast ocean circulation in the Atlantic could switch off or the Amazon rainforest could lose its ability to function as a rainforest okay so how on Earth could that help save the day well what if there weren't just tipping points for the planet but also for us people what if we could build up enough momentum for social dynamics that those tipped starting an Unstoppable irreversible path towards a cleaner future I'm guessing those questions are kind of the point of the study yeah which it answered by surveying over 100 experts the study looked at what we could do the interventions that could achieve these tipping elements the researchers called the social tipping interventions or STI wait STI yep I guess they didn't survey that 100 experts on whether phrases like STI in the education system could be open to misinterpretation apparently not okay well let's get stuck into the STI then please don't say that good call let's start by looking at the Energy System even though Renewables are now the cheapest form of energy ever there's still a bunch of financial hurdles actually making the energy transition so shifting subsidies away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy and creating power grids for decentralized power generation could push us towards the Renewables Tipping Point then there's the question of the financial system our financial system still invests hugely in fossil fuels those things that we need to leave in the ground and not burn if we're not going to overheat the planet y those things the divestment movement can help tip the financial system everyone from individuals to institutions could stop investing in fossil fuels potentially then reinvesting in projects that benefit society and the environment and to get our society on the right path we can start to shift our norms and values so people seeing fossil fuels and climate change as a moral issue right like the fact that fossil fuels Hammer the most vulnerable with pollution and extreme weather while raking in profits for the richest leaders taking a moral stand on fossil fuels could shift society's values especially spiritual leaders like Pope Francis but why do Society could also push towards this social Tipping Point like young activists who see our Energy System for what it is and demand change then there's the most important Tipping Point of all education is it actually the most important or are you just saying that because you focused your whole career on climate education please stick to the script fine please tell me more about the Fantastic role of Education I'd love to education has a crucial role in Social Transformations and climate change is no exception but most climate education is patchy at best we can build this up so we as a society understand the causes impacts and solutions to climate change change and I mean really understand so we can see our place in this how climate change harms Us and how we can be a part of the solutions and that's exactly what this channel is all about I make these videos without product placements or monetization because I don't want to sell you all rubbish that you don't need and honestly that's quite hard because apparently not selling things isn't exactly the best business model which is why I'm incredibly grateful to my amazing team of patrons who make all of this possible you can join them up here but if that's not for you all you climates who like comment and subscribe you're pretty amazing too so thank you you're welcome but this is the crucial takeaway from this research we can all help we can all push towards these social tipping points whether it's by supporting Community energy moving our money away from fossil fuels protesting for more Just Energy System or yeah helping spread reliable climate information like from climate scientists with phds from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change okay sure I'm posting now and it's not just that our individual action can help tip us to a climate friendlier Society it's also that these actions feed back on each other like better education can help shift our values which would make it easier to remove fossil fuel subsidies and Investments which helps cities to decarbonize I'm liking these kinds of tipping points and feedbacks when we think about climate change it's easy to feel disheartened after all climate change is this huge structural problem which requires huge structural Solutions it can feel like nothing is being done and that we individuals are powerless to do anything but these studies show that that's just not true countries are passing policies that are starting to bend our emissions curve and we can all push Society towards the Tipping points we need to Halt the heating and the truth is that halting the heating has never been more urgent like coral reefs the more we understand them the more we understand how vital they are for us and how vulnerable they are to the heating with throwing at them and here's why okay until next time byee it might be time for a haircut when I'm inhaling my hair"

      "transcript": "coral reefs are in hot water literally reefs are ecosystems like no other and we could be about to lose them to climate change an end to coral reefs would mean an end to their vital importance to the Natural and human worlds so what would a world without coral reefs look like and can we save the world's reefs I'm Adam a climate scientist with a PhD from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change and you really need to know about coral reefs this video isn't sponsored I don't want to sell you all stuff you don't need so no sponsorships no monetization if you're into that you can join my incredible patrons up here or just liking subscribing and commenting helps massively too now growing up in the UK pretty far from the nearest Tropical coral reefs I had the feeling that coral reefs were just these beautiful magical far off places and I mean they are but there's so much more than that too they are crucial for wildlife even though they cover less than 1% of the ocean surface they support over a quarter of all marine life and like with anything that's vitally important for the planet that means they're vitally important for people too you know because people live on the planet half a billion people across the globe depend on coral reefs for everything from food to financial income and because reefs break up strong waves they protect low-lying land from storms which is getting more and more important as climate change raises our seas and makes storms more powerful and maybe you don't care about any of this because you don't live anywhere near Coral Reef and you haven't discovered empathy well then you should know that by supporting the world's oceans coal reefs are also supporting the world's food system and economy so here comes the depressing bit these vital ecosystems are in serious danger you might have already heard of coral bleaching where beautiful vibrant reefs are transformed into these colorless wastelands to understand bleaching you need to understand that reefs are made up of tiny animals called Coral polyps and these live in harmony with algae that live inside their tissues and give corals their color by the way those visuals are from a film I made for the channel Planet a all about saving coral reefs link below low if temperatures sore the algae can freak out and the pop ends up kicking them out leaving the coral looking white and lifeless and that's what bleaching is bleached Coral isn't dead yet but lots of bleaching can end up fatal for polyps and lots of bleaching is exactly what's been happening the last year he seen reefs around the globe suffering from extreme ocean heat let's look at the Great Barrier Reef this is one of the seven natural wonders of the the world and Earth's largest coral reef system literally visible from space and yes the research for this video did include Googling fun facts about the Great Barrier Reef well here's a less fun fact about the Great Barrier Reef it suffered through five mass bleaching events in just 8 years including the one we've just seen and these are affecting huge suedes of the reef this year bleaching was recorded on 34s of the reefs that make up the entire system now you might have read the news that the Great Barrier Reef had made an incredible recovery over the last couple of years and don't get me wrong this is definitely good news but there is a limit to its goodness the recovery has largely been down to faster growing Coral species coming in which can also be very vulnerable when temperatures Spike again over the last year we've seen just how fragile this recovery can be when Rising temperatures stalled the growth in fact it can take decades for a reef to fully recover after severe Mass bleaching and as we heat the Seas more and more these events will start to take place so often that the Great Barrier Reef simply doesn't have time to recover the more we learn the more we realize just how extreme today's conditions are for coral and that's where a new study comes in to find out how the extreme heat of today compares to what Corals in the Great Barrier Reef are used to the researchers asked the corals I mean they obviously didn't literally ask the corals that would be ridiculous but I phrased it that way because it sounded more poetic what they actually did is look directly at the temperatures the corals themselves have experienced to do this they studied the skeletons of Boulder corals which can live for hundreds of years and form structures over 8 m tall bands in the skeleton like rings in a tree trunk revealed how hot the water has been over the past four centuries and over all this time the hottest temperatures were the five bleaching events that happened in the last 8 years on top of that the average temperature now is significantly hotter than it has been for the past 400 years by the way that doesn't mean that it was hotter 500 years ago than now it just means this record only stretches back 400 years and look this result is super important but it isn't exactly super surprising we already knew that average temperatures on Earth are now likely higher than they've been for over 100,000 years but investigating this on the local scale and really checking and seeing what corals themselves are adapted to well it really confirms that they are not adapted to the temperatures we're throwing at them today and it's not just boiling temperatures that we're throwing at them the carbon dioxide we're emitting is dissolving in the oceans and making Waters more acidic human activities are driving outbreaks of coral killing starfish harmful fishing practices are hammering reefs we're dumping all sorts of pollution into the Seas from sunscreen to plastic and when it comes to the Great Barrier Reef adding insult to injury Australia allows the shipping of fossil fuels across this world heritage area actually considering how damaging this could be to the reefs should really say adding injury to injury getting to grits with these threats really is a matter of life and death for the world's Coral us climate scientists compare different future worlds for example if the world Heats by 1.5 versus 2° C so this normally gives results like at 1.5° one in 17 insect species will lose most of their habitat but at 2° that'll be one in six insect species so 1.5° of global warming is bad for insects 2° is worse but for coal reefs it's not bad and worse it's bad and game over at 1.5° of global warming we're looking at 70 to 90% losses of coral reefs at 2° we're looking at over 99% of reefs lost that's what the intergovernmental panel on climate change found in 2018 and Recent research backs it up one paper looked at the regions of reefs that keep relatively cool when temperatures spike it found that when glob global warming reaches 1.5° these would make up just 0.2% of global coral reef cover when we pass 2° they wouldn't exist at all and it's important to point out that we're already dangerously close to the 1.5° Limit and current projections indicate we could heat the World by 3° by the end of this Century so these results mean there is a very real risk of the world losing these beautiful unique precious ecosystems within my lifetime okay so coal reefs are kind of screwed but fortunately there's lots of things we can do to unscrew them the most obvious and urgent things are remove all the harms that we can remove easily for example creating Marine protected areas protecting reefs from Shipping pollution and over fishing then there's all the stuff we could do to help corals adapt to more inhospitable conditions for example bringing in the toughest corals to the coolest regions of reefs helping entire reefs shift to cooler areas and even working in the lab to create heat resistant super corals all of this can help and all of this is being researched but none of this is a substitute for the real fix stopping climate change as long as we're pumping out greenhouse gases we're raising temperatures and acidifying the ocean given how incredibly vulnerable reefs are we need to stop climate change as quickly as possible and use every other solution we can get our hands on and personally I really do hope to live long enough to learn how we saved these incredible underwater environments and not to see how we lose them now as I was talking about 1.5° of global warming you might have thought of headlines like this and thought haven't we already passed 1.5° and the answer is actually no and here's why okay in till next time bye God I'm genuinely like bleaching as I record this because it is very warm"

      "published_at": "2024-07-30T13:09:12Z",
      "transcript": "later this year the United States will vote for its 47th president and from an assassination attempt to last minute candidate changes the race to the White House has made headlines before it's even fully begun Behind These headlines are two candidates kamla Harris and Donald Trump so when it comes to climate change what's actually the difference between these two candidates and what could the next president of the United States mean for the entire world I'm Adam a climate scientist with a PhD from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change and today I want to talk about the climate credentials of the next president of the United States I want to talk about this because what happens in the USA doesn't stay in the USA the US is the biggest historic emitter causing more climate change than any other nation and the US hugely influences what the world does to Halt global warming the past year has been an absolute scorcher and we're already feeling the devastation that climate change causes from extreme weather to the spread of disease and the tough truth is it's already incredibly late to limit warming to relatively safe levels at this point every single decision matters for how livable our future will be so let's talk about the decision that America is facing at the time I'm recording this is between Republican former president Donald Trump and the presumptive nominee of the democratic party current vice president kamla Harris now I know what you Americans are probably thinking who's a Brit like you to tell us Americans who to vote for and to that I would say two things firstly I hope you all appreciate the restraint it took to not do an American accent for that character and secondly my biggest audience is actually in the US and worldwide people are talking about Harris and Trump I've seen some people working on climate arguing that the two candidates are somehow equivalent and others going full Brat mode in their support for Harris so the point of this video is not to tell people who to vote for I just feel like it's important that people know the differences between the two candidates and that definitely includes the differences when it comes to climate change and that's really the first thing to spell out the two candidates are actually different really different let's look at their words first Donald Trump has repeatedly denied basic climate science saying things like it'll start getting cooler you just watch and arguing climate action harms Americans leav in American workers and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs lower wages shuttered factories quick note but Trump often argues that he opposes clean energy because he cares about jobs but clean energy jobs already hugely outnumber fossil fuel jobs in America okay but onto kamla Harris this is how she talks about climate change climate change has become a climate crisis and she's argued that when we invest in climate we create jobs we lower costs and we invest in families okay so great Harris says she believes that climate change is serious while Donald Trump denies the fundamentals but actions speak louder than words and that's one thing that's great about this presidential race we can actually look at the candidates actions what they've actually done when they've been in office one of the very first things that Donald Trump did was announced the US would exit the Paris climate agreement so we're getting out now slightly hilariously this only came into effect one day after the 2020 US presidential election which Trump lost to Joe Biden who then immediately rejoined the Paris climate agreement but even so the departure of the world's biggest historic emitter stalled Global action and upended negotiations in fact I was at the 2018 climate negotiations and Trump's climate in action was the backdrop to well to everything that was being discussed and Trump didn't just change the US's role on the international stage from approving major oil pipelines to Rolling back over 100 environmental rules Donald Trump has weakened emissions limits and reversed efficiency standards he also had a major impact on the courts appointing judges with anti-environment track records including Supreme Court Justices this led to the Supreme Court ruling restricting how the Environmental Protection Agency can control CO2 emissions after all this Trump still claims that I had the best environmental numbers ever which is misleading at best the improvements that were seen would generally cause by things like covid shutdowns pre-existing regulations and general Trends away from coal in other words some environmental measures improved despite Trump not because of him but it's hardly surprising that the man who has repeatedly called climate change a hoax isn't exactly a climate Champion the question is is kamla Harris actually any better well let's look at what's actually happened over the last four years while Harris served as vice president to Joe Biden most importantly they in UC the inflation reduction act often referred to as the IRA much to the confusion of British people like myself Harris cast the tiebreaking vote to pass the IRA which pushes hundreds of billions of dollars towards reducing emissions with subsidies for everything from solar panels to electric cars and this is a big deal for the climate in fact it's often held as the biggest deal for the climate in US history in terms of numbers the Environmental Protection Agency estimates it means reducing emissions by at least a third by 2030 relative to 205 levels and in terms of my personal experience I can genuinely say that many of the climate nerds that I know never thought we'd see such ambitious climate change policy from the US regardless of political party and speaking of shining endorsements I feel a sponsor message coming on well you feel incorrectly I don't want to sell you all things with my videos and so no monetization no product placements videos like this are entirely supported by my amazing patrons join them up here or if that's not for you just liking and subscribing are pretty good too can we get back to kamla Harris's record now sure we can look further back than just her time as VP as California District Attorney she set up an environmental justice unit to prosecute environmental crimes in California and that was almost two decades ago in 2005 and later as attorney general she secured multi million settlements on environmental violations from car companies and oil firms she even sued none other than the Obama Administration in an effort to Halt new offshore fracking permits and looking to the Future what her presidency might bring her climate adviser has said she would focus on implementing the inflation reduction act and it's worth pointing out that when she ran for Democratic Presidential nominee in 2019 her climate platform was way more ambitious than Biden's calling for everything from a carbon tax to a ban on fracking for oil and gas on public lands so it could be that should' be even more of a climate Champion than her predecessor if she becomes president in 2025 and while we're looking at what could happen in 2025 we have to talk about project 20 2 project 2025 is a 900 page far right blueprint by the Heritage Foundation for the next conservative presidency and it covers a lot of extremely concerning ground from potentially criminalizing people who provide abortions to eliminating the Department of Education seriously if you haven't heard of it definitely look into it some links for further reading as always are provided below Trump has tried to distance himself from it even claiming he knows nothing about it but this doesn't exactly check out half the blueprint authors worked under him during his presidency and he's mentioned in it hundreds of times and he previously said the Heritage Foundation would detail plans for what he would do in his next presidency but I digress here's what the project could actually mean for the climate it proposes scrapping what it calls climate alarmism but is actually vital Research into the threat climate change poses and the solutions we could take on top of that it would increase fossil fuel extraction on federal lands and halt the National Weather Services role as forecaster which would halt their life-saving extreme weather warnings on everything from tornadoes to heat waves and when it comes to pollution that directly harms the health of humans and the environment project 2025 takes a firm stand on the side of polluters emphasizing costs to Industry over environmental win-wins all in all this would mean a crisis for combating the climate crisis and there's good reason to think it's exactly what Trump is planning now don't get me wrong kamla Harris has overseen harmful climate policies too the Biden Harris Administration has for example given the green light to the willow project drilling oil in the Alaskan Arctic and fossil fuels are still receiving tax breaks plus the US is still not doing its fair share to limit global warming to 2° let alone 1.5° C these are the limits that would keep our planet relatively safe from the worst consequences of climate change so I guess this is the point where you make the lesser of two evils argument actually honestly no because when it comes to climate change we're still looking at a choice between a candidate who'd be who has been devastating for the climate and one who has overseen some of the most ambitious acts to protect our environment that the US has ever seen just to be clear the first one is Trump and the second one is Harris the truth is that we have seen big steps forward from Harris and that certainly contrasts with the giant leaps back that Trump has implemented in the past and hopes for in the future I thought you said you weren't going to tell us who to vote for and I'm not the goal of this video is to point out that when it comes to climate there are huge differences between these two potential presidents what you do with that information is obviously your call and of course there are many other factors that go into Who You'd vote for or whether you'd feel comfortable to vote at all from Reproductive Rights to the US economy to healthc care to the US's continued bipartisan support for Israel killing tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians but I will say this climate change can make us feel powerless but we're not every time we raise our voices on climate change we're Shifting the mercury in the thermometer and politics despite its ugliness and its huge flaws is one of our biggest opportunities to raise our voices and if you want to know just how powerful it can be to raise our voices then look no further than my conversation with Incredible climate scientist Katherine heho okay thanks a lot for watching until next time bye by estimat BL BL"

      "transcript": "in just 150 years we've dramatically altered the workings of our planet burning fossil fuels and dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere has disrupted our oceans our ecosystems and our weather so what happens after we stop emitting and I mean long after which of these changes to our planet are here to stay and what does that mean for the choices that we make today I'm Adam a climate scientist with PhD from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change and today I want to peer into the deep future of our climate the lessons we can learn up to 50,000 years from today and there's a reason I want to talk about this right now you see I just hit 50,000 subscribers and whether you've been a climate since the very beginning or you're just joining for the first time right now I'm really thrilled you're here to talk with me about climate change to celebrate this Milestone I'm going to see if I can still do a handstand on a skateboard I'm saving that right for the end of the video so stay tuned but really in this video I want to peer into our climate future normally when we talk about the future of climate changes we talk about the coming decades maybe up to 2100 and fair enough that's pretty relevant to everyone live right now but the choices we make today how we treat each other and the planet won't just affect us they'll also affect our Legacy the world we're leaving for Generations long into the future so then what climate Legacy are we leaving for these future Generations well of course there are limits to what we can know so stick around for the crucial caveats towards the end of the video but first let's start by looking at the main climate change culprit carbon dioxide and I want to get out of my apartment for this in 150 years we've completely changed our planet let's visualize that 150 years as a single step in that one step we've raised CO2 levels in our atmosphere higher than they've been in millions of years so the question is how long until those levels drop back down before making this video I honestly didn't know the answer to this question and I was curious what you all thought as well and about half of you Reon that it would take centuries from now for levels to get back to normal just a few steps from where I am now well you got it completely wrong and I'm incredibly disappointed in you because the actual answer is tens to hundreds of thousands of years you see all sorts of processes remove carbon dioxide from their air some of them are faster like plants and the upper ocean absorbing CO2 that process is actually called ocean Invasion which well it sounds a lot more exciting than it is but these Speedy processes can only do so much and then it's a job for carbon dioxide to make its way all the way to the bottom of our seas and into ocean sediments and because our oceans are so incredibly massive this takes thousands of years but even after all that some 10,000 years in the future there would still be like a fifth of the carbon dioxide we emitted left in the atmosphere like I cannot stress enough how Wild this is all that CO2 we emitted in just one single step and a massive chunk of it would still be around 70 steps 10,000 years into the future I mean 70 steps into the past this was cuttingedge technology for CO2 to get all the way back down to its original levels it would need to get absorbed by rocks and if you've ever watched a rock H you'll know they're pretty slow which means we're looking at hundreds of thousands of years for CO2 levels to get all the way back down that's like the entire length of this Runway I'm stood on okay time to head back indoors since the CO2 in our atmosphere acts as a blanket insulating our planet a thicker blanket for a long ass time means a hotter planet for a long ass time so how hot for how long well once we stop emitting CO2 our best estimate is that temperatures quickly stop going up or down at least for the first few decades more information on why up here but the story a few thousand years into the future isn't actually that different one study calculated that 2/3 of the heating we cause will still be around 10,000 years into the future that's this far from where we are today now it's important to point out how scientists look at questions like this we obviously don't have some crystal ball or some spare Earth we can do experiments on so we have to build one instead we build model Earths where the atmosphere ocean ice forests they all work as accurately as possible capturing the processes that we see here on our real Earth this model doesn't sit on top of a table though it runs on some of the most powerful supercomputers that humans have ever built and these computer models are incredible allowing us climate scientists to ask questions like what will temperatures look like in 10,000 years but these models aren't perfect so their answers aren't perfect either in fact different models can give slightly different answers one thing all the models agree on though is that the changes we've already caused and that we're still causing today we're stuck with a lot of it for many thousands of years and when I say we I mean uh children's Children's children's Children's children's Children's children's and when I say it I don't just mean we're stuck with higher temperatures I mean we're stuck with extreme weather that's more frequent and more extreme we're stuck with regions made harder to live in and harder to grow food in we're stuck with ecosystems pushed way out of balance and if we've crossed them we could be stuck with tipping elements these are aspects of our planet which could effectively collapse to a different state and then it's very hard to get them back the vast ocean circulation in the Atlantic regulating the world's weather could switch off or huge amounts of carbon could be released from Frozen regions if these things do happen and temperatures stay high for many thousands of years it would be very hard for these collapses to reverse and being stuck with higher temperatures also means we're stuck with higher Seas but ice and oceans take many thousands of years to balance out with the new temperatures so it's not that our seas would just stay high for thousands of years they would actually keep Rising for thousands of years long after CO2 levels and temperatures peaked say we limit global warming to 2° C that could mean about half a meter more sea level rise by the end of this Century enough to have serious consequences for the many millions of people living in coastal regions around the world but zoom out over the next 10,000 years and that's just the tip of the mostly melted Iceberg as se's would be some 10 m higher enough to redraw the lines on our maps and it's not like climate scientists are just guessing that this could happen we know that after our planet left the last ice age Seas kept Rising long after temperatures leveled out and past ice ages have something else to teach us too you see over the past hundreds of thousands of years the earth has experienced shifts in and out of these colder periods so the natural question is when will the next ice age start well a group of researchers looked at how carbon dioxide the Earth's orbit and the planet's ice are all linked they expect that the next ice age would start around 50,000 years into the future if humans hadn't emitted any carbon dioxide but we have emitted carbon dioxide and the emissions that we've already channed out today push the Ice Age way back making it highly unlikely in the next 120,000 years I don't say this because delaying the next ice age is necessarily inherently bad but this shows just how power powerful the planet altering effects of CO2 are half of the CO2 we've emitted we've emitted in just the last 30 years within my lifetime and this will have fundamental impacts on our planet not just over the coming decades but tens even hundreds of thousands of years into the future I mean 50,000 years into the past modern humans were making their way across the planet for the very first time and our actions today will profoundly affect our planet more than 50,000 years into the future as one of the studies I looked at in this video put it the decisions being made today will have profound and permanent consequences for future Generations as well as for the planet and today's decision makers do not have to live with the consequences of their decisions but let's take a deep breath because there are some very important disclaimers since we're talking about such vast time scales there's loads of other stuff that could happen in the meantime I'm talking volcanoes asteroids or honestly some processes that affect our planet's climate that we simply don't know or understand yet the projections described in this video are possibilities for our future not what will happen and on that note I know that these projections can make us feel powerless knowing that changes could stick around for so long but actually each and every one of these results makes clear just how much power we still have they show that actions we take to limit emissions now limit carbon dioxide concentrations not just today and tomorrow but for tens of thousands of years into the future and that means limiting the heating and all the other disruptive changes our planet goes through for all this time too which brings us to the biggest question mark in all of this us how quickly will we stop emitting and what will we do afterwards after all why stop at stopping emitting once we've learned to balance out our emissions why not keep cutting emissions and sucking up more and more CO2 why not shift from a society that treats the atmosphere and this entire planet as a Dumping Ground to a society that Treasures this home of ours and actively tries to restore it and look this channel is generally about what the science can tell us but how can science begin to tell us how our society will develop over the next decades centuries and Millennia so I know that this is very unscientific of me but I have to share that I really do believe that a kind of society that cares for community and the climate is possible and speaking of community it really does mean the world to me to have over 50 th000 of you climates here with me now I hate the idea of selling you all stuff that you don't need and so it's amazing being able to make videos like this one and not have to put ads or sponsor messages on it I can do that all thanks to my incredible patrons if you fancy it you can join them up here I don't know what this Channel's future will look like 50,000 more subscribers from now but I'm excited to go on that Journey with all of you and if you Valu this journey into our planet's distant future you might enjoy my trip into our home's deep past right enough about climate change time for the main event let's see whether I can still do a handstand on a skateboard okay until next time bye oh my gosh"

      "transcript": "heat waves are hitting us like never before summer is barely here in the Northern Hemisphere and we're already seeing people across the globe suffering under extreme heat and now research is making clear just how deadly these disasters can be so how is climate change turbocharging heat waves and what could we do to protect ourselves now and in the future I'm Adam a climate scientist with a PhD from Oxford sharing what you need to know about climate change and I didn't want to be making this video right now you see I just hit 50,000 subscribers and I planned a special video to celebrate that I was all ready to film and then this but seriously I am thrilled to have over 50,000 of you incredible climates in this community thank you all so much for being here and that celebration video is still coming and it's going to be a really good one peering into the deep future of climate change if you're not already make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss it okay but there's an important reason that I'm not making that video right now and it's because heat waves have been devastating our world and I really mean the world here there's been devastating heat all over temperature soaring above 50° C in Mecca killing over a thousand people who are making the hge pilgrimage more than four out of every five us Americans sweltering under extreme heat thanks to a weather phenomenon known as a heat Dome and then there's been the heat hitting Europe and Southern Asia and Eastern Asia so in sumary an extreme amount of extreme heat but as countless commenters Delight in pointing out uh we had heat waves before climate change too and they're right we did but today heat waves hit different you see by burning fossil fuels we're pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and heating the planet and surprise surprise heating the planet is making heat waves that used to be extremely rare more extreme but less rare but what might actually be a surprise is just how huge this effect can be for example scientists analyzed the start of the North American Heatwave and found that the extreme daytime temperature were made about 35 times more likely because of climate change the record-breaking nighttime temperatures around 200 times more likely in fact researchers have found that every single Heat Wave happening these days is made hotter and more likely because we're heating the planet so why why is extreme heat getting such extreme boosts from global warming well the technical explanation is that changes in the average have supersized effects on extremes but let me give you a less technical more anecdotal explanation if you've been watching this channel a while you might recognize it but cut me some slack I needed to make this video in like 2 days so I grew up in the UK but now live in Germany people in Germany are on average taller than people in the UK and as someone with average height for an adult British human I noticed this a lot when I moved here I definitely saw a lot more people who were 6' tall but I also noticed quite a few people who are 6' three a height that would be pretty rare in the UK what I really noticed though was the Super tall people you know their height so tall I basically never see anyone that tall in the UK but here occasionally I would see these people who had previously thought of as impossibly tall it's just the same with changes in temperature Shifting the average temperature up has heat boosting effects on every Heat Wave but by far the biggest impacts are on the most extremely tall I mean the most extremely hot events which go from being incredibly rare maybe even effectively impossible to actually happening and unlike all the tall people in Germany who at their worst give me a crick in my neck all this heat can be deadly while the Carnage they cause is much harder to visualize than it is for floods or fires or droughts heat waves are silent Killers too much heat means that the body can't regulate its internal temperature and your organs literally get too hot to function that means heat exhaustion and then eventually heat stroke and recent research looking at Europe shows that in just 20 years heat related deaths have shot up by almost a third this affects the most vulnerable Among Us think of little babies you know your elderly relatives and people who already have health issues but other people at high risk too you see the basics of protecting ourselves from heat waves aren't rocket science it's stuff like staying hydrated and staying cool indoors but how do you do that if you don't have decent housing or don't have housing at all or if you have to work outside to earn a living so we have to do more to protect the most vulnerable people from extreme heat this can mean better education so that people know what to do and what not to do when extreme heat hits it can mean better infrastructure whether that's better housing or short-term cooling centers and it can mean better support networks checking in on those vulnerable people in our communities but the hotter we make the Planet the more severe heat waves will have more often as we're already seeing today but the flip side of that is that once we stop heating the planet in other words we stop burning fossil fuels and stop emitting CO2 we stop heat waves getting worse so we should probably do that as soon as possible and if you need another reason to stop heating the planet here's what could happen to the Amazon rainforest if we don't get our AXS together okay until next time bye"
